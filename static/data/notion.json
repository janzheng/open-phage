bacteria is essential. Bacterial lawns are prepared in semi solid overlay agar (for Pseudomonas and _E. coli_ , we will use LB broth with 0.7% agar). In some cases, salts (e.g., MgCl2 and CaCl2, final concentration up to 4 mM and/or 2 mM, respectively) are added to enhance adsorption of phages to bacterial receptors.\n\n","  **Aim:**  Learn how to prepare a good confluence culture of bacteria in a semi-solid agar and test phage activity using spot test.\n\n","  \n\n","  ## **Materials** \n\n","  - 0.1% crystal violet solution\n\n","  - Distilled water\n\n","  - 500 uL of phage UP2a stocks\n\n","  - 500 uL of overnight PA5 bacterial culture in LB broth\n\n","  - 2 allots of warm semi-solid LB overlay containing 0.7% agar (always keep this at 55oC until needed)\n\n","  - 10 mL of sterile SM buffer or LB broth\n\n","  - 2 LB agar plates\n\n","  \n\n","  \n\n","  ## I. **Practice serial dilution using crystal violet** \n\n","  To practice 10-fold serial dilution (in a total of 1 mL volume), please use the crystal violet solution provided. Follow the instructions below:\n\n","  1. Add 900 µL of the diluent (water in this case) to each of eight 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and mark the tubes as 10-1 to 10-8.\n\n","  1. Transfer 100 µL of the 0.1% crystal violet solution to the first tube marked 10-1 and mix by pipetting up and down several times. Discard the tip.\n\n","  1. Using a fresh tip, take 100 µL from the tube marked 10-1 and add this to the next tube marked 10-2. Mix again by pipetting up and down several times. Discard the tip.\n\n","  1.

Conduct a 10-fold serial dilution of phages in cold SM buffer/filtered LB broth provided. To do this:\n\n","  1. Add 900 µL of the diluent (SM buffer/LB broth in this case) in eight 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and mark as 10-1 to 10-8.\n\n","  1. Transfer 100 µL of the phage stock to the first tube marked 10-1 and mix by pipetting up and down several times. Discard the tip.\n\n","  1. Using a fresh tip, take 100 µL from the tube marked 10-1 and add this to the next tube marked 10-2. Mix again by pipetting up and down several times. Discard the tip.\n\n","  1.

Apply 10 µl of each diluted phage lysate to the marked sections on the duplicate agar plates.\n\n","  1.

bacteria is essential. Bacterial lawns are prepared in semi solid overlay agar (for Pseudomonas and _E. coli_ , we will use LB broth with 0.7% agar). In some cases, salts (e.g., MgCl2 and CaCl2, final concentration up to 4 mM and/or 2 mM, respectively) are added to enhance adsorption of phages to bacterial receptors.\n\n","  **Aim:**  Learn how to prepare a good confluence culture of bacteria in a semi-solid agar and test phage activity using spot test.\n\n","  \n\n","  ## **Materials** \n\n","  - 0.1% crystal violet solution\n\n","  - Distilled water\n\n","  - 500 uL of phage UP2a stocks\n\n","  - 500 uL of overnight PA5 bacterial culture in LB broth\n\n","  - 2 allots of warm semi-solid LB overlay containing 0.7% agar (always keep this at 55oC until needed)\n\n","  - 10 mL of sterile SM buffer or LB broth\n\n","  - 2 LB agar plates\n\n","  \n\n","  \n\n","  ## I. **Practice serial dilution using crystal violet** \n\n","  To practice 10-fold serial dilution (in a total of 1 mL volume), please use the crystal violet solution provided. Follow the instructions below:\n\n","  1. Add 900 µL of the diluent (water in this case) to each of eight 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and mark the tubes as 10-1 to 10-8.\n\n","  1. Transfer 100 µL of the 0.1% crystal violet solution to the first tube marked 10-1 and mix by pipetting up and down several times. Discard the tip.\n\n","  1.

Repeat B2-B3 till the 8th dilution (See Figure 1).\n\n","  1. Label plates with your group number and date.\n\n","  1. Prepare lawns of bacteria in semi-solid agar. To do this collect 4 mL LB semi solid agar in a 15 ml tube (for each LB agar in 90 mm Petri dishes) from the water bath/55oC incubator. (For steps B7-B8, you need to act very fast or else the semi solid agar will solidify).\n\n","  1. Add 100 µL of the overnight bacterial culture to the semi solid agar.

Apply 10 µl of each diluted phage lysate to the marked sections on the duplicate agar plates.\n\n","  1. Place the plates under a lightened Bunsen burner with the top lid slightly open for approximately 5 min for the spotted solution to set.\n\n","  1. Repeat steps B6-B10 for the second marked LB agar plate\n\n","  1. Incubate plates overnight at 37°C.\n\n","  1. The next day, count plaques on an appropriate dilution spot to have more than 10 plaques.\n\n","  1. Record your observations in Table 1.\n\n","  1.

bacteria is essential. Bacterial lawns are prepared in semi solid overlay agar (for Pseudomonas and _E. coli_ , we will use LB broth with 0.7% agar). In some cases, salts (e.g., MgCl2 and CaCl2, final concentration up to 4 mM and/or 2 mM, respectively) are added to enhance adsorption of phages to bacterial receptors.\n\n","  **Aim:**  Learn how to prepare a good confluence culture of bacteria in a semi-solid agar and test phage activity using spot test.\n\n","  \n\n","  ## **Materials** \n\n","  - 0.1% crystal violet solution\n\n","  - Distilled water\n\n","  - 500 uL of phage UP2a stocks\n\n","  - 500 uL of overnight PA5 bacterial culture in LB broth\n\n","  - 2 allots of warm semi-solid LB overlay containing 0.7% agar (always keep this at 55oC until needed)\n\n","  - 10 mL of sterile SM buffer or LB broth\n\n","  - 2 LB agar plates\n\n","  \n\n","  \n\n","  ## I. **Practice serial dilution using crystal violet** \n\n","  To practice 10-fold serial dilution (in a total of 1 mL volume), please use the crystal violet solution provided. Follow the instructions below:\n\n","  1. Add 900 µL of the diluent (water in this case) to each of eight 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and mark the tubes as 10-1 to 10-8.\n\n","  1. Transfer 100 µL of the 0.1% crystal violet solution to the first tube marked 10-1 and mix by pipetting up and down several times. Discard the tip.\n\n","  1.

Conduct a 10-fold serial dilution of phages in cold SM buffer/filtered LB broth provided. To do this:\n\n","  1. Add 900 µL of the diluent (SM buffer/LB broth in this case) in eight 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and mark as 10-1 to 10-8.\n\n","  1.

Repeat B2-B3 till the 8th dilution (See Figure 1).\n\n","  1. Label plates with your group number and date.\n\n","  1. Prepare lawns of bacteria in semi-solid agar.

Apply 10 µl of each diluted phage lysate to the marked sections on the duplicate agar plates.\n\n","  1.
