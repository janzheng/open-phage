Online!\n\n","  \n\n","  Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an

0:00\n\n","    Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory. In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.\n\n","    So the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.\n\n","    We have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.\n\n","    phages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.\n\n","    Here's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.\n\n","    We accomplish this mission in two general programs. The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.\n\n","    So these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.\n\n","    From their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.\n\n","    Our first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process. And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019. And we actually had participants from six different countries in West Africa that was hosted in Ghana. And then most recently, in January 2020. We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.\n\n","    Let me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform. We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops. In the most recent East Africa workshop. They came from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, they represented 14 different institutions. And they came from all different levels within their careers, graduate students, technicians, research assistants, lecturers, professors, professors and government scientists. And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.\n\n","    funders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible. So we're very grateful for this community involvement.\n\n","    At this workshop, we had our three original instructors, Professor Martha cloaky, from the University of Leicester, in the UK, and Dr. Janet nali. Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching. This time we had Slav, mich new ski from the University of Warwick in the UK.\n\n","    And the goals of each workshop are not only to learn phage biology and experimental techniques, but also this is really important to develop a network of phage researchers starting in the given region, East Africa or say Southeast Asia, and then helping to connect them to other researchers throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US are America and\n\n","    the topics covered include phage, ecology, molecular biology, various models for studying how phages interact with their bacteria phage applications in agriculture, including both animals and crops, phage therapy, compassionate use cases as well as clinical trials. And then each of the instructors talks about their current area of phage research to give some very practical examples of how phages might be applied. We also try to help the participants of the workshop prepare to get funding for their phage product projects, and also how to engage with the public that might be with a few\n\n","    consumers of their phage product, the regulatory authorities, whoever it may be,\n\n","    to get the support, they'll need to get phages utilized in their country. And then we're constantly compiling collection of key scientific publications. And we discussed that many of those during the workshops.\n\n","    So just to give you an idea, at the end of the first two week workshop, as I said, which was hosted in Uganda in 2017, we were able to successfully isolate some phages, we being the participants of the workshop with support from the instructors. And so here are some transmission electron microscope images, microscopic images of some of the phages that were isolated. We've named these all up for Uganda phage, to a through five B. These were originally isolated from a sewage plant outside Kampala, Uganda, pure originally purified in Uganda and then further characterized back in the UK. And all of these have been made available to the participants of the workshop. So it's exciting to see that within just two weeks, phages can begin to be isolated by these workshop participants.\n\n","    I mentioned that the network develop and the development and the relationships is a really important part of this. And I'm highlighting this spend a few hours together in a sewage plant, and it's a very bonding experience. You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.\n\n","    So let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.\n\n","    Starting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.\n\n","    Then after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And\n\n","    then, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants. So they were either starting new projects or significantly modifying projects that they'd previously initiated, because they'd learned some key things from attending our workshop. There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.\n\n","    Even more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.\n\n","    And at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first\n\n","    from all of the\n\n","    workshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's\n\n","    Just within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.\n\n","    So now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.\n\n","    Our intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries. And it's akin to this saying from Lao Tzu and Martha cookie first made this slide. If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. And so as Martha rewarded this, if you give a woman or man a phage, you may treat one infection. Teach a woman or man how to isolate phages and you may treat multiple infections caused by many different pathogens. And that's our goal and hope here. Thanks much.\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n","  &lt;a  rel=prefetch href=\"/lectures\" class=\"_button __cta __width-full _margin-top-2 _margin-bottom-none-i\"&gt;Explore our phage lectures&lt;/a&gt;\n\n"],"children":["355baba6-8a4a-4f83-99ad-f0daccbb63e8","d5994f1d-693d-44c5-bc6b-ae38859d28ff","04ab2ccd-b475-4528-8b74-34fd11acb1a8","e15810e1-b8af-42f8-98a1-b9f2b019d45e","d8168f97-7df0-41b9-92a9-f2720da84a05","3120190e-9616-442b-b80c-4bc40e1f6aae","fd9d7b53-b8c6-481e-8a84-b0e206168abd","9c79e99c-f3b6-4848-bf6e-62c93f3304af"],"content":[{"id":"355baba6-8a4a-4f83-99ad-f0daccbb63e8","type":"text","parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"d5994f1d-693d-44c5-bc6b-ae38859d28ff","type":"text","value":"Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!","properties":{"title":[["Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!"]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!\n\n"]},{"id":"04ab2ccd-b475-4528-8b74-34fd11acb1a8","type":"text","parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"e15810e1-b8af-42f8-98a1-b9f2b019d45e","type":"text","value":"Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions.","properties":{"title":[["Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions."]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions.\n\n"]},{"id":"d8168f97-7df0-41b9-92a9-f2720da84a05","type":"text","parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"3120190e-9616-442b-b80c-4bc40e1f6aae","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","              Tobi Nagel 0:00\n\n","              Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory. In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.\n\n","              So the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.\n\n","              We have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.\n\n","              phages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.\n\n","              Here's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.\n\n","              We accomplish this mission in two general programs. The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.\n\n","              So these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.\n\n","              From their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.\n\n","              Our first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process. And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019. And we actually had participants from six different countries in West Africa that was hosted in Ghana. And then most recently, in January 2020. We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.\n\n","              Let me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform. We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops. In the most recent East Africa workshop. They came from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, they represented 14 different institutions. And they came from all different levels within their careers, graduate students, technicians, research assistants, lecturers, professors, professors and government scientists. And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.\n\n","              funders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible. So we're very grateful for this community involvement.\n\n","              At this workshop, we had our three original instructors, Professor Martha cloaky, from the University of Leicester, in the UK, and Dr. Janet nali. Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching. This time we had Slav, mich new ski from the University of Warwick in the UK.\n\n","              And the goals of each workshop are not only to learn phage biology and experimental techniques, but also this is really important to develop a network of phage researchers starting in the given region, East Africa or say Southeast Asia, and then helping to connect them to other researchers throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US are America and\n\n","              the topics covered include phage, ecology, molecular biology, various models for studying how phages interact with their bacteria phage applications in agriculture, including both animals and crops, phage therapy, compassionate use cases as well as clinical trials. And then each of the instructors talks about their current area of phage research to give some very practical examples of how phages might be applied. We also try to help the participants of the workshop prepare to get funding for their phage product projects, and also how to engage with the public that might be with a few\n\n","              consumers of their phage product, the regulatory authorities, whoever it may be,\n\n","              to get the support, they'll need to get phages utilized in their country. And then we're constantly compiling collection of key scientific publications. And we discussed that many of those during the workshops.\n\n","              So just to give you an idea, at the end of the first two week workshop, as I said, which was hosted in Uganda in 2017, we were able to successfully isolate some phages, we being the participants of the workshop with support from the instructors. And so here are some transmission electron microscope images, microscopic images of some of the phages that were isolated. We've named these all up for Uganda phage, to a through five B. These were originally isolated from a sewage plant outside Kampala, Uganda, pure originally purified in Uganda and then further characterized back in the UK. And all of these have been made available to the participants of the workshop. So it's exciting to see that within just two weeks, phages can begin to be isolated by these workshop participants.\n\n","              I mentioned that the network develop and the development and the relationships is a really important part of this. And I'm highlighting this spend a few hours together in a sewage plant, and it's a very bonding experience. You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.\n\n","              So let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.\n\n","              Starting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.\n\n","              Then after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And\n\n","              then, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants.

This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's\n\n","              Just within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.\n\n","              So now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.\n\n","              Our intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have.

auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:02\n\n","    Hi there. Today I thought we'd talk about phage therapy. So I have a few sort of lectures will break them up into several pieces about phage therapy, and we'll talk about compassionate use cases, mostly Shauna, in another series of lectures is going to talk to you about clinical trials. I'm going to talk about more than one off cases. But we'll talk about some of the principles of face therapy before that, and we'll get to that in just a minute. So just to get you guys excited for it, I thought I'd introduce the case first. And this was the first case that we treated Yale, this was back in 2016. And it was one of the more sort of recent big cases that sort of, well, it's sort of started the momentum phage therapy, sort of helped bring it where it is, a so this case is the case of a prosthetic vascular graft infection with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And so this case started with an 80 year old male that had an aortic aneurysm. And what that is, is this vessel coming out of the heart that walls will slightly weakened, and it started bleeding out. And if this ruptures to\n\n","    catastrophic\n\n","    event, and certainly fatal, and so when there's sign of an aneurism like this, especially in the aorta, it needs to be repaired. And so what happened was this individual went under, and went to surgery and had an aortic arch replacement. And so what they did is they cut off a chunk of the aorta, and they replaced it with a piece of paper on and so they grafted this onto the aorta back in 2012. And so, you know, shortly after, after infection, and hit a, you know, a really bad infection post surgery, which spread to the sternum and actually eventually had to go in and remove the sternum and a lot of bone.\n\n","    As a result,\n\n","    in 2013, he came back to hospital with bacteremia, especially with monus. And then he also had draining fistula. So what that was, is there was basically a whole draining from his chest. He also had environment that was draining process and Pseudomonas. And its origin was a face of getting worse. When this happened, they manage this infection with iv subterra, Diem, and Cipro and then they also provided more the chest wall. And then they sent them home. But he was admitted three additional times in 2013, with, you know, increased drainage from the fistula, and bacteremia again, so he would be on antibiotics, he'd stopped taking them after the course was done. And then five days later, he would be back screaming. So for those of you that may not know what a meme is, it's when there's bacteria in the blood. So it's a pretty serious infection. Okay, so in October 2014, he had a imaging done, and it showed an increase of fluid at the base of the aorta, which is how they identified the infection site and the cultures that they pulled from the drainage or intermediate resistant to Cipro. And so they started IPsec. Again, and just as before, when he would stop taking sagacity he had fever and vektory me again. So this went on for another year. So he's been on antibiotics for, geez, two years now. And then by late 2015, actually, some blood started coming out of this fistula. And it was concerning because people thought that maybe the infection had eroded into the base of the aorta, and it was leaking a little bit. And if that happens, you know, that's the equivalent of an aneurysm rupturing. So this is a problem because, due to his advanced age, they couldn't go in and surgically remove the graft and replace it with a different\n\n","    one.\n\n","    And so, because of risk of mortality, so we were looking for alternative ways of which we might treat this case. This is our first case. We'll talk more about it later. Before we get there, I thought we'd talk about some of these a couple of historic cases. So these are from courtesy of a friend of mine from country of Georgia, who told me about these cases. And they were, these four cases happened in Georgia. And the first one is a radiation burn on those infected with Staph aureus. So this individual had a pretty severe radiation Bernice can see on a zero here, which failed to resolve after a month of hospitalization. The then treated him they started treating them with bacteria phages, with a product called h biodome, which is like a bandage that's, that contains pages for staff equal, like klebsiella, and Pseudomonas. So they basically placed this bandage on his burn daily. And then by day seven, basically, that was the the wound looked like it was improving, as you can see in the photos here, and it was less drainage of us. And when they did cultures of the wound, they saw that they were negative. So it looks like phages, in combination with antibiotics might have helped resolve\n\n","    that wound.\n\n","    And the next one is a severe wound as you can see, those infected by Pseudomonas, and this was a 46 year old male with severe trauma to the left forum. He had this injury, fishing accident, he was fishing with explosives, legally, and he was injured. So on day three, there, you can see that he has a very severe trauma to his arm. And cultures of arm revealed Pseudomonas and staph epidermidis. So they began treating with obviously, in addition to chemical and biotics, they treated with phage, your Georgian product called pFh, which contains pages that kill staph, strep pneumo, of pneumo, echolife, Proteus, and Pseudomonas. So they were basically irrigating this wound site with it, there was some improvement by day seven, as you can see, and obviously, they've, they've been doing surgery consistently to remove active tissue, dead tissue, and to try and preserve the hand. On day 10. He had some vessels rupture and repair in emergency surgery. See, but basically, you know, by six months, he's of constant phage treatment and antibiotic treatment and surgical intervention, he's able to retain his limb here. And so you know, these these sort of cases are exciting and suggest that maybe phage have a role to play in infection management, particularly and drug resistant infections. So one of the differences between phages and antibiotics, right, so there's actually quite a few. They're both tools that are used to try and kill bacteria. In phage therapy, you know, they used to treat infection logically, but they're different than chemical antibiotics in some ways. So for chemical antibiotics, you sort of need to know that the knowledge of the infectious strain, within reason, oftentimes, they'll treat with antibiotics, water waiting for cultures to come back, at least in the US. phages, you definitely need to know what strain is causing the infection, because phage are very, very specific in their killing. And so it's very easy to give the wrong phage. If you don't know what strain and actually test with strain is causing the infection phage particles are also quite large, especially compared to chemical antibiotics, maybe 10,000 times the size, at least. And so this can bring up a bunch of issues in terms of potential immune recognition, which we'll talk about in one of the compassionate cases later. dosage is critical for chemical antibiotics to lower the dose know that with a bunch of antibiotic resistant bacteria and no change in clinical status too high and you have the issue of toxicity. dose in phage is also critical, but I think it's less calculate. Generally phage treatment is a function of multiplicity of infection. So the number of pages are bacteria. And so determining does is a little bit difficult functional dose that is, but the dose is also difficult because once you've administered phage, and they start killing bacteria, they're going to replicate right so this is going to change your effective dose in the body. A resistance to phages evolves very quickly, especially individual phages. If you grow them in the lab, as you'll do in this course, you'll find that that phages, resistance to these phages evolves overnight. It with chemical antibiotics, it actually can evolve a bit slower, depending on the antibiotic, and the mechanism of resistance. Some bacteria just don't have these mechanisms in place to be resistant, so we can take quite a while to evolve them. Okay, so at about a toxicity can be very high to do relatively low, right. So there are some lastline antibiotics that are extremely toxic, but use them as a drug of last resort. phages, on the other hand, seem to have a very high therapeutic index that is that they're very appear very safe, right. So independent of dose, you don't seem to see negative side effects. And over several orders of magnitude, which is much different than you would expect from a chemical and about. So we're different ministration is variable in both chemical and bage.\n\n","    demonstrated efficacy, clear the antibiotics if demonstrated history of working, whereas phages we're working on it still, at least in the US, Canada and Western Europe. Intellectual property, which is sort of a driver for a lot of companies is trivial in antibiotics, right? You identify a new compound patent on it, and then you're okay. phages, it's different because they're, you know, considered living organisms. And so intellectual property can be a bit more\n\n","    complicated.\n\n","    And then, as I said previously, the spectrum of activity for phages is extremely narrow, oftentimes phages, in fact, one or a couple of strains, whereas chemical antibiotics, it's relatively broad, it's certainly at least compared to\n\n","    bacteria phages. So if you're going to end up trying to develop\n\n","    phage, as a therapeutic, there's a few things that want you to consider and this is clearly a not comprehensive list, but consider at least some of the right the relevant ministration is critical. Will the phage be exposed to low pH salinity? How would they get to the bacteria. So if you have a blood infection, and you give a pill, the phages exposed to the stomach, and then how many of them are actually going to cross from the digestive system into the blood? Right, this is a very important question. And you want to be sure that the phage actually get to the site so that they can do their job. immune response is a another consideration. So as I mentioned before, there are large particles, so the immune system will eventually recognize them. And navigating that space can be difficult. So you want to be sure that we're not just giving IV phage for every possible infection, because the immune system is going to be involved. Those is going to be important. So you're going to have to figure out what the best functional doses. And there's a bunch of trade offs around dosing. Obviously, there's some you might need to dilute your product down if you can't purify it as well. But also, you need to be sure that you're giving enough phage that they actually can do their job, because it's not like one phage particle, gets into a wound and then clears all the bacteria. In theory, this is what happens, what could happen at least. But in practice, this is not know what happens phage have to find a bacteria in replicating. And it's actually although you know, it appears to be a small infectious site. Viruses are ages bacteria, they're all very, very, very small, right? So even if you have bacteria, you know, a 10th of a millimeter away. That's a long distance to travel and a phage that doesn't have a way to move, it has to work on Brownian motion to end up getting there. And that's not simple as it might seem. The composition of the process and be critical. Like Are there going to be other chemicals in the phage product that are antagonistic or they kill the phage stuff to consider is the phage stable in this excipient these are things you're gonna have to test before you deploy your phage you also need to know the storage conditions for the product, for example, you know, is it gonna be refrigerated frozen, these things are all gonna be critical and be especially important as you try and develop phages in a large scale. So route of administration, as I said is critical. How, how this happens is going to be um, you know, I listed five of them here. Um, for example, eye drops. So you know, There's been phage that have just been applied a traffic to it to treat an infection. And there's you know, injection, whether it's into the circulatory system or just into muscles tissue this way. They're suppository or also by mouth. So that said, you know, pills or little capsules, you can take a phage to try and treat some infections. One that we've done a lot recently is naturalization. So, we have basically did the inhalation that phages via nebulizer a and then you know, in any other way that drugs have been delivered, and perhaps some that haven't been so what your goal should be when you're developing this product is to select a route of administration that maximizes delivery, maximizes the delivery of viable phages while minimizing the risk to the patient, if so, be a nebulizer, it, in theory will help treat a lung infection. The nebulizer itself, maybe aerosolized in the phages, damages the phages, just to be sure that page actually are functional, as they get to the discussion site is tied to the infection site. And you want to minimize the rest of the patient at the same time, obviously. Alright, so let's talk about immune response here. So as we were saying that large particles and the adaptive immune system will eventually recognize\n\n","    bacteriophage.\n\n","    So does this impact therapy? Like it might not? But as it, I would imagine, it probably does. And that's something that needs to be investigated. What happens when the age do their well, and they kill a bunch of bacteria, lice in the bacteria, and all these endo and EXO toxins just burst out of the bacteria that can elicit a pretty strong immune response. And these are things to consider when you're developing a treatment. So what about dosing? How many pages should we give? How frequently should we apply them? For example, right? So should you just give, as this cartoon suggests, you know, some agent day, one day, two day three day, or should you just throw it all in on day one, just go for it and do a one and done situation. Um, it depends on the infection, it's going to depend on severity, infection, individual patient is going to depend a lot. Um, so in terms of dosing, we're also going to talk about multiplicity of infection, as is often abbreviated m i. And it's simply the number of viral particles per bacteria in a system, right? So if you have a flask, and you're trying to, and you have 10, to the seven bacteria per mil, and there's 10 mils, there's 10 of eight total bacteria. With those 10 and eight bacteria, are you and you want an MRI of 100, you have to add 10 to the 10, platforming units of phage. Okay, so an MRI of 100 means 100, platforming units of bacteria, or phage, or bacteria. Okay, so hypothetically, if you're trying to remove 10 to the seventh bacteria from a liquid culture in a single infection cycle 10 to the seven phage is enough, right? So you're throwing one phage particle and for every bacteria nut should be sufficient to kill everyone,\n\n","    right?\n\n","    No, that's actually\n\n","    NASA do with sort of random distribution. Okay, so it's a bit of math here, it's not really critical unless you're interested in it. But it's here to illustrate sort of theory, okay. So if you look at the cosine distribution, it's the equivalent of, you know, if you have, you know, if we were actually in a different time, and we're chatting in person, and you add, you know, 100 students in this class, 10 rows of 10. And I had, you know, a bucket of 100, tennis balls and one tennis ball for each of you. And I just threw them out, you know, just took the bucket and launched it out at you. The probability that everyone gets one is very low, right, the probability that some of you get none very high probability if someone gets to is also a possibility, right. And so, when you are trying to solve these sort of, you know, hypotheticals here, you basically solve the fraction of uninfected cells which is zero. So the first equation here is the fraction of the population it's not infected. The next equation, where k equals one is the number of bacteria that are single phage. And then you know, after that, you can just look at actual infected by more than page Okay. So, um, when you do that, it will help you understand the minimum number of pages you need in order to expose all the bacteria to at least one phage particle initial administration. Okay. So for like a, you know, hypothetical example here, imagine that Jerry can actually see these are boys that are used to collect water in many parts of the world. And so, you know, in a typical Jared candidate 20 leaders say you fetched water from a river and it contains a total in this can have 10 to the nine, see if he's a video call, right, so there's a cholera outbreak upstream and down here in the water, you have cholera. So, if they're 10 to the ninth Cfu is a Vibrio, there's 5% for CFS per ml M. And if you just took 10 to that IPF use of video footage so you see knew you had a face that could kill this video, we had to tend to the night phage This is an MRI of 110 of the night face and like bacteria. When you crunch through randomly mixing and do the math, the number of bacteria that are never exposed to phage on the first encounter is 367 million CFCs. Right. So this first number here infects 20,000 people in can. So if you use mo I have one and treat. There's still enough bacteria in this can not been exposed to page. There's enough bacteria in this chair can infect 4000 people. Okay, so what if instead of 10 to the ninth, we made an MRI of 10. So we had a 10 to the 10th ef use the same jerrycan and mixed it up. We had the number of bacteria that were not exposed to a phage 450 cF use is not enough to cause an infection. In most people, the overwhelming majority people do and just for DCF use, you're not going to get an MRI of 10. If you can treat this jerrycan with ny 10 it should make it clean enough to drink. So, you know in summary that ensuring that bacteria exposed to the phage immediately upon dosing. If you're going to do that, then you need to try for MIF 10 right? Otherwise, you have to rely on either frequent dosing or replication within those and replication within the person is difficult to depend on. Is this it's just there's a lot of variables. So how do you determine the bacterial density? Right so someone comes in with you know klebsiella pneumoniae infection and pneumonia say, How do you know how many bacteria they have? Very difficult. You probably can't. But the best you can do is estimate. And then even still, it's pretty accurate. But you know, our general policy is to try and throw as many pages as possible at it while maintaining safety. And so that's sort of the approach we've taken, we've more or less standardized our dose here for some of these respiratory infections.\n\n","    But as I'd say the deaths would be completely different from other infections or even other bacteria. And we just picked a dose that sort of maximize the number of pages while minimizing the number of toxins and staying within the current FDA regulations.\n\n","    \n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["8613afc2-cb51-4029-ad65-943b5a41176a"],"content":[{"id":"8613afc2-cb51-4029-ad65-943b5a41176a","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"2514b2e7-7f71-42a4-9610-2ec5493d6414","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:02\n\n","    Hi there.

So just to get you guys excited for it, I thought I'd introduce the case first. And this was the first case that we treated Yale, this was back in 2016. And it was one of the more sort of recent big cases that sort of, well, it's sort of started the momentum phage therapy, sort of helped bring it where it is, a so this case is the case of a prosthetic vascular graft infection with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And so this case started with an 80 year old male that had an aortic aneurysm. And what that is, is this vessel coming out of the heart that walls will slightly weakened, and it started bleeding out. And if this ruptures to\n\n","    catastrophic\n\n","    event, and certainly fatal, and so when there's sign of an aneurism like this, especially in the aorta, it needs to be repaired. And so what happened was this individual went under, and went to surgery and had an aortic arch replacement. And so what they did is they cut off a chunk of the aorta, and they replaced it with a piece of paper on and so they grafted this onto the aorta back in 2012. And so, you know, shortly after, after infection, and hit a, you know, a really bad infection post surgery, which spread to the sternum and actually eventually had to go in and remove the sternum and a lot of bone.\n\n","    As a result,\n\n","    in 2013, he came back to hospital with bacteremia, especially with monus. And then he also had draining fistula. So what that was, is there was basically a whole draining from his chest. He also had environment that was draining process and Pseudomonas. And its origin was a face of getting worse. When this happened, they manage this infection with iv subterra, Diem, and Cipro and then they also provided more the chest wall. And then they sent them home. But he was admitted three additional times in 2013, with, you know, increased drainage from the fistula, and bacteremia again, so he would be on antibiotics, he'd stopped taking them after the course was done. And then five days later, he would be back screaming. So for those of you that may not know what a meme is, it's when there's bacteria in the blood. So it's a pretty serious infection. Okay, so in October 2014, he had a imaging done, and it showed an increase of fluid at the base of the aorta, which is how they identified the infection site and the cultures that they pulled from the drainage or intermediate resistant to Cipro. And so they started IPsec. Again, and just as before, when he would stop taking sagacity he had fever and vektory me again. So this went on for another year. So he's been on antibiotics for, geez, two years now. And then by late 2015, actually, some blood started coming out of this fistula. And it was concerning because people thought that maybe the infection had eroded into the base of the aorta, and it was leaking a little bit. And if that happens, you know, that's the equivalent of an aneurysm rupturing. So this is a problem because, due to his advanced age, they couldn't go in and surgically remove the graft and replace it with a different\n\n","    one.\n\n","    And so, because of risk of mortality, so we were looking for alternative ways of which we might treat this case. This is our first case. We'll talk more about it later. Before we get there, I thought we'd talk about some of these a couple of historic cases. So these are from courtesy of a friend of mine from country of Georgia, who told me about these cases. And they were, these four cases happened in Georgia. And the first one is a radiation burn on those infected with Staph aureus. So this individual had a pretty severe radiation Bernice can see on a zero here, which failed to resolve after a month of hospitalization. The then treated him they started treating them with bacteria phages, with a product called h biodome, which is like a bandage that's, that contains pages for staff equal, like klebsiella, and Pseudomonas. So they basically placed this bandage on his burn daily. And then by day seven, basically, that was the the wound looked like it was improving, as you can see in the photos here, and it was less drainage of us. And when they did cultures of the wound, they saw that they were negative. So it looks like phages, in combination with antibiotics might have helped resolve\n\n","    that wound.\n\n","    And the next one is a severe wound as you can see, those infected by Pseudomonas, and this was a 46 year old male with severe trauma to the left forum. He had this injury, fishing accident, he was fishing with explosives, legally, and he was injured. So on day three, there, you can see that he has a very severe trauma to his arm. And cultures of arm revealed Pseudomonas and staph epidermidis. So they began treating with obviously, in addition to chemical and biotics, they treated with phage, your Georgian product called pFh, which contains pages that kill staph, strep pneumo, of pneumo, echolife, Proteus, and Pseudomonas. So they were basically irrigating this wound site with it, there was some improvement by day seven, as you can see, and obviously, they've, they've been doing surgery consistently to remove active tissue, dead tissue, and to try and preserve the hand. On day 10. He had some vessels rupture and repair in emergency surgery. See, but basically, you know, by six months, he's of constant phage treatment and antibiotic treatment and surgical intervention, he's able to retain his limb here. And so you know, these these sort of cases are exciting and suggest that maybe phage have a role to play in infection management, particularly and drug resistant infections. So one of the differences between phages and antibiotics, right, so there's actually quite a few. They're both tools that are used to try and kill bacteria. In phage therapy, you know, they used to treat infection logically, but they're different than chemical antibiotics in some ways. So for chemical antibiotics, you sort of need to know that the knowledge of the infectious strain, within reason, oftentimes, they'll treat with antibiotics, water waiting for cultures to come back, at least in the US. phages, you definitely need to know what strain is causing the infection, because phage are very, very specific in their killing. And so it's very easy to give the wrong phage. If you don't know what strain and actually test with strain is causing the infection phage particles are also quite large, especially compared to chemical antibiotics, maybe 10,000 times the size, at least. And so this can bring up a bunch of issues in terms of potential immune recognition, which we'll talk about in one of the compassionate cases later. dosage is critical for chemical antibiotics to lower the dose know that with a bunch of antibiotic resistant bacteria and no change in clinical status too high and you have the issue of toxicity. dose in phage is also critical, but I think it's less calculate. Generally phage treatment is a function of multiplicity of infection. So the number of pages are bacteria. And so determining does is a little bit difficult functional dose that is, but the dose is also difficult because once you've administered phage, and they start killing bacteria, they're going to replicate right so this is going to change your effective dose in the body. A resistance to phages evolves very quickly, especially individual phages. If you grow them in the lab, as you'll do in this course, you'll find that that phages, resistance to these phages evolves overnight. It with chemical antibiotics, it actually can evolve a bit slower, depending on the antibiotic, and the mechanism of resistance. Some bacteria just don't have these mechanisms in place to be resistant, so we can take quite a while to evolve them. Okay, so at about a toxicity can be very high to do relatively low, right. So there are some lastline antibiotics that are extremely toxic, but use them as a drug of last resort. phages, on the other hand, seem to have a very high therapeutic index that is that they're very appear very safe, right. So independent of dose, you don't seem to see negative side effects. And over several orders of magnitude, which is much different than you would expect from a chemical and about. So we're different ministration is variable in both chemical and bage.\n\n","    demonstrated efficacy, clear the antibiotics if demonstrated history of working, whereas phages we're working on it still, at least in the US, Canada and Western Europe. Intellectual property, which is sort of a driver for a lot of companies is trivial in antibiotics, right? You identify a new compound patent on it, and then you're okay. phages, it's different because they're, you know, considered living organisms. And so intellectual property can be a bit more\n\n","    complicated.\n\n","    And then, as I said previously, the spectrum of activity for phages is extremely narrow, oftentimes phages, in fact, one or a couple of strains, whereas chemical antibiotics, it's relatively broad, it's certainly at least compared to\n\n","    bacteria phages. So if you're going to end up trying to develop\n\n","    phage, as a therapeutic, there's a few things that want you to consider and this is clearly a not comprehensive list, but consider at least some of the right the relevant ministration is critical. Will the phage be exposed to low pH salinity? How would they get to the bacteria. So if you have a blood infection, and you give a pill, the phages exposed to the stomach, and then how many of them are actually going to cross from the digestive system into the blood? Right, this is a very important question. And you want to be sure that the phage actually get to the site so that they can do their job. immune response is a another consideration. So as I mentioned before, there are large particles, so the immune system will eventually recognize them. And navigating that space can be difficult. So you want to be sure that we're not just giving IV phage for every possible infection, because the immune system is going to be involved. Those is going to be important. So you're going to have to figure out what the best functional doses. And there's a bunch of trade offs around dosing. Obviously, there's some you might need to dilute your product down if you can't purify it as well. But also, you need to be sure that you're giving enough phage that they actually can do their job, because it's not like one phage particle, gets into a wound and then clears all the bacteria. In theory, this is what happens, what could happen at least. But in practice, this is not know what happens phage have to find a bacteria in replicating. And it's actually although you know, it appears to be a small infectious site. Viruses are ages bacteria, they're all very, very, very small, right? So even if you have bacteria, you know, a 10th of a millimeter away. That's a long distance to travel and a phage that doesn't have a way to move, it has to work on Brownian motion to end up getting there. And that's not simple as it might seem. The composition of the process and be critical. Like Are there going to be other chemicals in the phage product that are antagonistic or they kill the phage stuff to consider is the phage stable in this excipient these are things you're gonna have to test before you deploy your phage you also need to know the storage conditions for the product, for example, you know, is it gonna be refrigerated frozen, these things are all gonna be critical and be especially important as you try and develop phages in a large scale. So route of administration, as I said is critical. How, how this happens is going to be um, you know, I listed five of them here. Um, for example, eye drops. So you know, There's been phage that have just been applied a traffic to it to treat an infection. And there's you know, injection, whether it's into the circulatory system or just into muscles tissue this way. They're suppository or also by mouth. So that said, you know, pills or little capsules, you can take a phage to try and treat some infections. One that we've done a lot recently is naturalization. So, we have basically did the inhalation that phages via nebulizer a and then you know, in any other way that drugs have been delivered, and perhaps some that haven't been so what your goal should be when you're developing this product is to select a route of administration that maximizes delivery, maximizes the delivery of viable phages while minimizing the risk to the patient, if so, be a nebulizer, it, in theory will help treat a lung infection. The nebulizer itself, maybe aerosolized in the phages, damages the phages, just to be sure that page actually are functional, as they get to the discussion site is tied to the infection site. And you want to minimize the rest of the patient at the same time, obviously. Alright, so let's talk about immune response here. So as we were saying that large particles and the adaptive immune system will eventually recognize\n\n","    bacteriophage.\n\n","    So does this impact therapy? Like it might not? But as it, I would imagine, it probably does. And that's something that needs to be investigated. What happens when the age do their well, and they kill a bunch of bacteria, lice in the bacteria, and all these endo and EXO toxins just burst out of the bacteria that can elicit a pretty strong immune response. And these are things to consider when you're developing a treatment. So what about dosing? How many pages should we give? How frequently should we apply them? For example, right? So should you just give, as this cartoon suggests, you know, some agent day, one day, two day three day, or should you just throw it all in on day one, just go for it and do a one and done situation. Um, it depends on the infection, it's going to depend on severity, infection, individual patient is going to depend a lot. Um, so in terms of dosing, we're also going to talk about multiplicity of infection, as is often abbreviated m i. And it's simply the number of viral particles per bacteria in a system, right? So if you have a flask, and you're trying to, and you have 10, to the seven bacteria per mil, and there's 10 mils, there's 10 of eight total bacteria. With those 10 and eight bacteria, are you and you want an MRI of 100, you have to add 10 to the 10, platforming units of phage. Okay, so an MRI of 100 means 100, platforming units of bacteria, or phage, or bacteria. Okay, so hypothetically, if you're trying to remove 10 to the seventh bacteria from a liquid culture in a single infection cycle 10 to the seven phage is enough, right? So you're throwing one phage particle and for every bacteria nut should be sufficient to kill everyone,\n\n","    right?\n\n","    No, that's actually\n\n","    NASA do with sort of random distribution. Okay, so it's a bit of math here, it's not really critical unless you're interested in it. But it's here to illustrate sort of theory, okay. So if you look at the cosine distribution, it's the equivalent of, you know, if you have, you know, if we were actually in a different time, and we're chatting in person, and you add, you know, 100 students in this class, 10 rows of 10. And I had, you know, a bucket of 100, tennis balls and one tennis ball for each of you. And I just threw them out, you know, just took the bucket and launched it out at you. The probability that everyone gets one is very low, right, the probability that some of you get none very high probability if someone gets to is also a possibility, right. And so, when you are trying to solve these sort of, you know, hypotheticals here, you basically solve the fraction of uninfected cells which is zero. So the first equation here is the fraction of the population it's not infected. The next equation, where k equals one is the number of bacteria that are single phage. And then you know, after that, you can just look at actual infected by more than page Okay. So, um, when you do that, it will help you understand the minimum number of pages you need in order to expose all the bacteria to at least one phage particle initial administration. Okay. So for like a, you know, hypothetical example here, imagine that Jerry can actually see these are boys that are used to collect water in many parts of the world. And so, you know, in a typical Jared candidate 20 leaders say you fetched water from a river and it contains a total in this can have 10 to the nine, see if he's a video call, right, so there's a cholera outbreak upstream and down here in the water, you have cholera. So, if they're 10 to the ninth Cfu is a Vibrio, there's 5% for CFS per ml M. And if you just took 10 to that IPF use of video footage so you see knew you had a face that could kill this video, we had to tend to the night phage This is an MRI of 110 of the night face and like bacteria. When you crunch through randomly mixing and do the math, the number of bacteria that are never exposed to phage on the first encounter is 367 million CFCs. Right. So this first number here infects 20,000 people in can. So if you use mo I have one and treat. There's still enough bacteria in this can not been exposed to page. There's enough bacteria in this chair can infect 4000 people. Okay, so what if instead of 10 to the ninth, we made an MRI of 10. So we had a 10 to the 10th ef use the same jerrycan and mixed it up. We had the number of bacteria that were not exposed to a phage 450 cF use is not enough to cause an infection. In most people, the overwhelming majority people do and just for DCF use, you're not going to get an MRI of 10. If you can treat this jerrycan with ny 10 it should make it clean enough to drink. So, you know in summary that ensuring that bacteria exposed to the phage immediately upon dosing. If you're going to do that, then you need to try for MIF 10 right? Otherwise, you have to rely on either frequent dosing or replication within those and replication within the person is difficult to depend on. Is this it's just there's a lot of variables. So how do you determine the bacterial density? Right so someone comes in with you know klebsiella pneumoniae infection and pneumonia say, How do you know how many bacteria they have? Very difficult. You probably can't. But the best you can do is estimate. And then even still, it's pretty accurate. But you know, our general policy is to try and throw as many pages as possible at it while maintaining safety. And so that's sort of the approach we've taken, we've more or less standardized our dose here for some of these respiratory infections.\n\n","    But as I'd say the deaths would be completely different from other infections or even other bacteria. And we just picked a dose that sort of maximize the number of pages while minimizing the number of toxins and staying within the current FDA regulations.\n\n","    \n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["bc40b933-c203-47c4-ae29-51856035a298","4adad8e2-0b6b-45da-b351-dba62ac79713","379cfd00-36bb-4b72-a84d-7bc2aaa71280","ecf2b491-aeff-471c-9fd5-2a55711f1706","5ab54ba3-3ddb-4de9-ad3c-e91b457780ae","d599f2b3-dfd4-4955-8f1e-10ecd57bf700","9fec49c5-394c-461c-81a1-2a619e664b64","ded2f880-ca24-469e-b1a5-c363fcd18a7b","e38f2ae0-bf05-42f5-b9b8-66523c6227ac","539a4df3-adc1-46f6-a5bc-6625850d0433","1c0e2707-25f2-4240-95a6-75037e4eb289","b40487ba-5463-4246-a88c-dcb98bf65651","d563eea7-fa29-458b-a79b-dd9243fc6f42","2164e41c-42a4-432f-afd8-73c9888f84b6","7f48b1b6-6293-44b8-b4d9-3c9b409fe159","10d01556-dcaa-4476-a508-e5a395d6a439","ad9cbc73-53e7-48a7-992e-7f82fd0ae55e","41723f14-c307-4e6a-a4cf-c2c6d6197ebb","2d0ca1a3-4562-461c-b59e-42a76c66fece","b8670377-83a8-4c2f-9638-ffabff260628","2866aa70-05ec-4850-a634-e54f00657695","efb9562a-98fc-437d-a3fe-5c81e811d94c"],"content":[{"id":"bc40b933-c203-47c4-ae29-51856035a298","type":"text","value":"Ben Chan 0:02","properties":{"title":[["Ben Chan 0:02"]]},"parent_id":"8613afc2-cb51-4029-ad65-943b5a41176a","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Ben Chan 0:02\n\n"]},{"id":"4adad8e2-0b6b-45da-b351-dba62ac79713","type":"text","value":"Hi there.

And then they sent them home. But he was admitted three additional times in 2013, with, you know, increased drainage from the fistula, and bacteremia again, so he would be on antibiotics, he'd stopped taking them after the course was done. And then five days later, he would be back screaming. So for those of you that may not know what a meme is, it's when there's bacteria in the blood. So it's a pretty serious infection. Okay, so in October 2014, he had a imaging done, and it showed an increase of fluid at the base of the aorta, which is how they identified the infection site and the cultures that they pulled from the drainage or intermediate resistant to Cipro. And so they started IPsec. Again, and just as before, when he would stop taking sagacity he had fever and vektory me again. So this went on for another year. So he's been on antibiotics for, geez, two years now. And then by late 2015, actually, some blood started coming out of this fistula.

And you want to minimize the rest of the patient at the same time, obviously. Alright, so let's talk about immune response here.

And so I think it's worth actually taking a few minutes to find it. So, page binding is a pretty complicated process actually requiring recognition by the bacteria phage have specific receptor or receptors that are expressed on the surface of bacteria. So in my cartoon here, on the left, the blue face, there's bouncing around in the environment, and then the green wood is the cell wall of the bacteria, right? So it comes into contact with some protein or sugar or fat or something. If it's not the right one, it bounces back off and doesn't find it, it doesn't bind. So these receptors are present necessarily on all members of a genus, and usually not even all members of a species, right. So it is or, as we said, you know, countless times during the series, incredibly specific, eight. And so part of that specificity, a pretty good chunk of it is due to just h 90 b being able to find material, not recognizing the appropriate receptor. So, you know, once it does find the appropriate receptor, it binds to it and then continues its its reproductive process, as we discussed in previous lectures, right. So specificity as is so complicated. And it means that material failure credibly host specific, and this is good or bad. Right? So, I guess I would say it depends take difficult to get a solid answer, I know, depends, right. So, historically, it was considered bad, because you need to know a lot of information about the spectra in order to determine whether this page can be used. However, now that we're appreciating the microbiome, and we're recognizing all these like collateral damage from some of these other antimicrobials, I think we're coming to appreciate the microbiome and its value to health. And so I think the specificity, specificity is actually quite good in that it allows for like a really personalized medicine. So let's consider the specificity here, or maybe here as a form of infection. Patient pressure, right? So in this cartoon, the left of a circle of the life cycle bacteria phage, right. So in a closed system, bacteria grow phage grow, they're going to be constantly infecting the bacteria. However, within the population of bacteria, mutation, will up or standing diversity might be sufficient if it's already present, so that the phage can no longer kill trade eight. So this evolved resistance so clear that evolved resistance to particular phage could be directed right, I'm saying can be directed to reduce a reverse antibiotic resistance or possibly attenuate virulence, I mean by that is, if we're careful in choosing what the bacteria phage is using as it binds to its bacterial host, could select for a phage that utilizes some component of bacterial virulence or antibiotic resistance, such that when the bacteria mutate away from phage, and become resistant to them, it comes at a cost by being increased, seemingly sensitive to antibiotics or maybe having more sorry, decreased virulence. Right? So this lower right, is just showing that it's a trade off between phage sensitivity and antibiotic resistance are very cool. So, you know, in theory, that's great. But what about in practice? I'm going to show a few examples here on how at least in the lab, we can, we can demonstrate this trade off. Okay. So, starting with mucoid strains of Pseudomonas, right, so we have Phage, or several bacteria, Pseudomonas require now going to capsule to infect a, we'll get what that is in a minute. Here. In the bottom, I have a cartoon of Pseudomonas bacteria and those 10 colored antibodies, right. So normally, if it's swimming around in the body, antibodies can just stick on to some antigenic sites, flagging it, or destruction by the immune system. However, sometimes bacteria form a capsule. So in monus, it's more made out in it and it can actually Cover somebody\n\n","    antigenic sites, so that anybody can recognize the site anymore. Okay, well, we have phage that require a capsule in order to infect. And what the result is, is bacteria that evolve resistance to this age no longer amoeboid which could potentially be capitalized upon, you know, therapeutically, so that we can directly against New quality and perhaps work together with the immune system to help clear an infection. So in experimental work, we've shown that, you know, just just summarize that, we've shown that within three days, we can drive mucoid variants extinct with this page, which is the blue line here, and this is control phage, these different phage, which cannot infect mucoid bacteria, so this strain that we used is, has variants and amoeboid and non so right, so within a population, expose it to phage, and then we serially passaged it for three days. So in the orange line, it was a phage that cannot infect mucoid bacteria, and by the end of three days, we clearly see that mucoid bacteria are dominant, right, which makes sense, because they're resistant to page, on the blue one, the mucoid variants are sensitive to phage. And by day three, there, extinct, so everybody was none. Because this phage cannot infect non mucoid bacteria. So it's one way we can try and toggle equality in Pseudomonas, we can also target these outer membrane vesicles. So some of these outer membrane vesicles are just bits of cell wall that contain toxins, if they can promote adhesion and cause inflammation, destroy tissues, that kind of stuff. So basically, they're spewing out these little self icicles. So we have a bacteria that utilizes the O antigen, and origin of the bonus to say, in fact, in the resistant mutants do not have this antigen. And for some reason, which we're still investigating, this actually prevents them from producing remember signals. And so when we look in the supination of these bacteria that are resistant to phage. It shows evidence of this being the case,\n\n","    in that\n\n","    we look for the presence of the last days. So we did a simple last days essay, where we grew up the bacteria in the presence of Cipro flexisign, which is not known to have an impact on the last day of action. So at the end of the day, we wrote up in sub lethal concentrations of Cipro, spun it down quantify the last days and saw the last days, with erythromycin, which has been known to reduce elastase production. We grew it up, spin them down, testicle essays, it was negative, and the same thing happened with bacteria phage. satin is a it's another virulence factor secreted it causes oxidative stress and production of free radicals. it sprays out causing damage allowing the bacteria to action, we have a phage that when we expose bacteria to it and bacterial resistance, they reduce production of pass and almost zero, and I send an insect green pigment that is characteristic of Pseudomonas. We treated with sub lethal concentrations of antibiotics as well. Cipro carbenicillin, enough for my son, and this plot here is showing how much house and they are relative to the ancestor. After 48 hours, Cipro actually increased by seven, almost 50%. Relative to the ancestor, our carbon asanas was indistinguishable. erythromycin, a fourth column, the white one showed a big reduction. And then h6 is the fade all the way to right column, it should have big reduction, right? Interestingly, we were able to get rid of the increase due to Cipro by combining page of Super. Okay, so when you're designing a phage product, what's the competition gonna be like? I can use a single phage a cocktail pens, right? So it depends, like everything in therapeutics in biology. And there are cases in which a cocktail might be viable in cases in which a single phage over time might be and will hopefully try and make an argument for or single phage at the cocktail is pretty straightforward. But when we get to that point of lecture, discuss it. So if you consider the evolution of phage resistance when developing products, um, I think there can be a pretty strong case for serial model phage therapy, and we'll discuss in a minute, versus pulling them all together as a cocktail. We'll talk about that a bit later in some future slides here. But something else to consider is storage of phage. So many phases are stable for long periods of years with minimal loss of tighter at room temperature in media they were grown in. So we in the lab, one of the previous instructors of this course, Katie Wright, who's a student in the lab, she cracked open lysate of T six that was bottled in 1954, and still had locking tighter, and this is the year 2020. Um, so you know, 50, more than 50 years, at room temperature in, you know, liriope broth, and this still has pocking, tighter. And other faiths that we have, you know, within a week, we're down one order of magnitude. So it really is phage dependent. powdered formulations can be very, very, very stable, right? This, the ees laflife page can be stable for theoretically, you know, hundreds of years. Um, however, it can be costly to produce and optimize them to get the right sugar content. And you do lose some faith at the beginning, just as you would, if you were to store them at minus 80, you lose a bunch of pages beginning but then they're stable for basically forever until you rehydrate them or when you lose a bit more, but stability is definitely, um, the liquid formulation to be stable require more space also, right. So if your lab size is limited, and you need to store 10,000, phage, and you know, 100 ml eloquence, and take up a lot of space,\n\n","    um,\n\n","    however, and definitely, if you're going to ship these around, it can get costly to ship them. So that's another issue to consider.\n\n","    So\n\n","    I'll stop the second here. But, you know, consider the possibility of using multiple phages, Senior Center, but different parts of their center, right, avoid issues resistance, waiting a trade off. So what happens if you use all phage? targeting opsi? Right, that's really strong selection against the expression. So I would predict the deletion of this gene. Continued strong, strong, selective pressure. Best of luck to try your own. And maybe by the time you see this lecture, we'll have a couple of papers out showing the difference between cereal age and cocktails in the works\n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["cad46df2-4dbd-46d2-be8d-fcc4a18a4441"],"content":[{"id":"cad46df2-4dbd-46d2-be8d-fcc4a18a4441","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"bc9ac4cb-a3c1-446e-a524-794493aec2c2","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:01\n\n","    Okay, so to continue some lectures on phage therapy, again, my contact information is at the bottom if you feel the need to email or choppy instrument. so critical to phage therapy is actually age binding, it's really important biologically and may be a source of a lot of stages. And so I think it's worth actually taking a few minutes to find it. So, page binding is a pretty complicated process actually requiring recognition by the bacteria phage have specific receptor or receptors that are expressed on the surface of bacteria. So in my cartoon here, on the left, the blue face, there's bouncing around in the environment, and then the green wood is the cell wall of the bacteria, right? So it comes into contact with some protein or sugar or fat or something. If it's not the right one, it bounces back off and doesn't find it, it doesn't bind. So these receptors are present necessarily on all members of a genus, and usually not even all members of a species, right. So it is or, as we said, you know, countless times during the series, incredibly specific, eight. And so part of that specificity, a pretty good chunk of it is due to just h 90 b being able to find material, not recognizing the appropriate receptor. So, you know, once it does find the appropriate receptor, it binds to it and then continues its its reproductive process, as we discussed in previous lectures, right. So specificity as is so complicated. And it means that material failure credibly host specific, and this is good or bad. Right? So, I guess I would say it depends take difficult to get a solid answer, I know, depends, right. So, historically, it was considered bad, because you need to know a lot of information about the spectra in order to determine whether this page can be used. However, now that we're appreciating the microbiome, and we're recognizing all these like collateral damage from some of these other antimicrobials, I think we're coming to appreciate the microbiome and its value to health. And so I think the specificity, specificity is actually quite good in that it allows for like a really personalized medicine. So let's consider the specificity here, or maybe here as a form of infection. Patient pressure, right? So in this cartoon, the left of a circle of the life cycle bacteria phage, right. So in a closed system, bacteria grow phage grow, they're going to be constantly infecting the bacteria. However, within the population of bacteria, mutation, will up or standing diversity might be sufficient if it's already present, so that the phage can no longer kill trade eight. So this evolved resistance so clear that evolved resistance to particular phage could be directed right, I'm saying can be directed to reduce a reverse antibiotic resistance or possibly attenuate virulence, I mean by that is, if we're careful in choosing what the bacteria phage is using as it binds to its bacterial host, could select for a phage that utilizes some component of bacterial virulence or antibiotic resistance, such that when the bacteria mutate away from phage, and become resistant to them, it comes at a cost by being increased, seemingly sensitive to antibiotics or maybe having more sorry, decreased virulence. Right? So this lower right, is just showing that it's a trade off between phage sensitivity and antibiotic resistance are very cool. So, you know, in theory, that's great. But what about in practice? I'm going to show a few examples here on how at least in the lab, we can, we can demonstrate this trade off. Okay. So, starting with mucoid strains of Pseudomonas, right, so we have Phage, or several bacteria, Pseudomonas require now going to capsule to infect a, we'll get what that is in a minute. Here. In the bottom, I have a cartoon of Pseudomonas bacteria and those 10 colored antibodies, right. So normally, if it's swimming around in the body, antibodies can just stick on to some antigenic sites, flagging it, or destruction by the immune system. However, sometimes bacteria form a capsule. So in monus, it's more made out in it and it can actually Cover somebody\n\n","    antigenic sites, so that anybody can recognize the site anymore. Okay, well, we have phage that require a capsule in order to infect. And what the result is, is bacteria that evolve resistance to this age no longer amoeboid which could potentially be capitalized upon, you know, therapeutically, so that we can directly against New quality and perhaps work together with the immune system to help clear an infection. So in experimental work, we've shown that, you know, just just summarize that, we've shown that within three days, we can drive mucoid variants extinct with this page, which is the blue line here, and this is control phage, these different phage, which cannot infect mucoid bacteria, so this strain that we used is, has variants and amoeboid and non so right, so within a population, expose it to phage, and then we serially passaged it for three days.

And by day three, there, extinct, so everybody was none. Because this phage cannot infect non mucoid bacteria. So it's one way we can try and toggle equality in Pseudomonas, we can also target these outer membrane vesicles. So some of these outer membrane vesicles are just bits of cell wall that contain toxins, if they can promote adhesion and cause inflammation, destroy tissues, that kind of stuff. So basically, they're spewing out these little self icicles. So we have a bacteria that utilizes the O antigen, and origin of the bonus to say, in fact, in the resistant mutants do not have this antigen.

Right. And in order to get to the national cases, I thought we'd start off talking about\n\n","    involved.\n\n","    And just for, you know, example, we'll talk about Pseudomonas, because this is bacteria that said, spend\n\n","    So if you look at these effects, mumps and Pseudomonas called, most of them are Mac's, which that's multi response. And then they're named like max AB, okay, so that just has to deal with Max's multidrug efflux, and then a B would be the inner and transmembrane protein names. And then OPR is our membrane protein and then so other name so that they existed before chemical antibiotics were developed by humans, they, they do pump them out, and to pump out solvents, dyes, biocides cell signaling molecules, they're just great stuff. So no, factory, sorry, material kicks in and out of otic, but they recognize it.\n\n","    And of these six, four of them use the same outer membrane component OPR, as you can see here with this red letters,\n\n","    and these pumps, at least the OPR m gene is under stabilizing selection. This gentleman here in the lower left corner is named Mark sistrum. He works for me as an assistant professor at University of California, Merced said, and he analyzed genomes of all published Pseudomonas, specifically looking at remembering protein M. and found this under strong stabilizing selection, which means is highly conserved. So it's very similar in Pseudomonas, you pull from sewer versus UTI versus plant infection, all using the same OPR.\n\n","    And, you know, some of our earlier work showed that we tested a bunch of isolates from all over sewage, you know, infections, UTI, dog ear infections that were sensitive to the phage. And we tested the MRC. So that's the minimum inhibitory concentration of several antibiotics in three different groups broadly, those that efflux provides resistance, those that effects may provide resistance or provide some resistance, and then those three folks does not provide resistance. Right. So you'll see here in third column the MSE of\n\n","    these bacteria to these\n\n","    antibiotics. We then exposed it to phage on cat one and pulled resistant colonies from where we grew up those resistant bacteria tested MIT again and we got the following results right. So, we have a reduction of micc in the ones where effects provide resistance, big reduction, medium reduction in those where effects make fragile sense and no change where you know, existence okay. So, in several of these actually showed reversion from clinical resistance to susceptibility Alright, so, to confirm this receptor, and this is the this sort of work is stuff that you can do for like, all phages that just those using these, you know, remember, this, I mean, should probably do for all the phages discovery, you should at least know the receptor stability, its genomes, you know, all these things, right. So, just as an assembler determinant, we used a transpose on knockout we tense so basically a transposable element is inserted in, in the genes. So in this, we test it against one where transposons inserted in the atom every m gene. And we also tested this max R, which is the repressor of C flux system. So, for these e flux xenobiotics, the wild type is resistant, the knockout had a increased sensitivity. And then the repressor one is knocked out as a is still resistant, as you would expect. Something which is not a fluxed. That unchanged. We then tested face sensitivity and found that it was at the oprf knockout was resistant to facial hair culture sensitive,\n\n","    perfect strongly suggest that's the receptor. So we did this over time also with a reader. So the Y, I'm going to show you a plot here where the y axis is cell density as measured by od 600. And then time across the x eight, so when so should be color coordinated here. But you look at the wild type with ethos capable in the presence of subinhibitory\n\n","    Okay, so now let's jump way back to another section of lectures when I was talking about the very first case, right, so this is the case of the aortic aneurysm. We talked about that lectures ago. I told you we get back to it. Now the point we're getting back to\n\n","    Getting reagents that grew up resistant to the phage and we tested the MRC again, and we saw a big decrease in Cipro, gentamicin tobramycin. And also some testing. As we saw a general improvement in bio sensitivities of black bars in Cipro, gentamicin and Bryson represent clinical breakpoints for these drugs. So what we saw is reversion from clinical resistance to sensitivity to these drugs, simply by involves page resistance.\n\n","    So I took the data to the surgeons and they were like, awesome, this is what we need to do. Let's treat this guy, right. So you know if you're going to develop a therapy, this is like basic identifying like you have it's therapy. You sample you tested sensitivity of the bacteria isolate seven\n\n","    strains ideally, in a well characterized library, grow up the phage, concentrate, phage endotoxin, and EXO toxins dialyze it, you know, contaminants, prepare to doses and then confirm the low endotoxin concentration, and then you should be ready to go. Right. So I realized I say it like it's some simple tasks, means one of the steps requires a lot of work. But it's certainly something can be done in most labs.\n\n","    Well, that was not possible. So we tried doing this for three hours in the theater, and we were unable to puncture this, this little collection of fluid, do heavy scarring. So you know, it like obsessed and like, walled off, and it was scarring.\n\n","    So we did that and discharged him four weeks post procedure, he developed a bunch of bleeding from that fistula, and, you know, very concerning, right, because you're like, Oh, my God, the,\n\n","    because of this illness, where the physicians there, identify that pinkeye, pseudocyst and drain so they saw these little systems as they drained them, and they pulled us into the vector bahmani. Right. So they stabilized in there with some antibiotics. And then they flew him to California for treatment. And by time he ended up in California, this bug was actually Pandora resistant, which means is resistant to the available chemical antibiotics.\n\n","    So this point, they started working on a potential phage treatment. And they just were administered for eight weeks, I believe, 16 weeks, sorry, 16 weeks via washing the abscess areas and by IP. Let me see what goes on there. What they gave.\n\n","    They were also this guy was also given several endo biotics via IV vancomycin meropenem cost into cycling. And they also added azithromycin on day 36 of his treatment. This is combination of work between several groups went to Texas, the Navy, California\n\n","    And the bottom blue line, there is the duration of IV therapy with phage. Right, and the pots on the right are growth charts similar to the one I showed you previously.\n\n","    It's similar to this right, so similar optical density over time, this is using a proprietary technology by one of the authors on the paper, that is functionally the equivalent\n\n","    So with this case, they also were able to pull blood samples because the guy was admitted in hospital. So it's pretty straightforward, the easy blood. And they found that faders were actually readily removed from serum. So you know, they took control minus five minutes, five minutes, 30 minutes, 6183 60. And then they pulled blood, and they quantified age. And they found you know, before face every there's no age, see, in five minutes, they had one point 10 fourth pfds per mil,\n\n","    by 30 minutes, it was down to four times in a third an hour, it was almost undetectable, and one. So within an hour they're gone from. And also importantly, is that serum collected at the end of the study showed neutralizing antibodies. So they basically found that the antibody immune system had recognized the phages in the cocktail and would kill them. So this is by the end of the study. I don't know if it determined the point at which this happened. But by 16 weeks, it was resistant. By day eight, the blood cultures were all resistant to the phages test as far as I understand. But they continued using IV phage. In case there was some there were still sensitive. Following 16 weeks of fake treatment, including a six week coma, he just woke up one day. And he's been working ever since he looks great. He's out talking. You can Google him, he's he's a very nice guy. And you can read all about it, hear all about it on YouTube, with his wife on the left, she's written a book about it. And you can find this on Google. And so that's that's the case in California. So after that case, we ended up creating quite a few pulmonary cases. So because of a press from that case, and in our prior one, we started getting contacted by a bunch of individuals or physicians with cases that they were treating or their sub selves and family members with infections that they were looking for alternatives because the cases I'm about to tell you are, are of those flavors. This one we'll call case was a young woman with cystic fibrosis. So it's a genetic disease that results in, you know, thick mucus production, and they are prone to pulmonary infections. So in this case, right here, this woman had chronic pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa that's, you know, that's a very, very common bacteria in cystic fibrosis, okay. So she historically had a baseline febe one, which is the forced expiratory volume of air that individuals breathe out at one second\n\n","    of 90%. So that just means that she had 90% lung function of someone without CF of her age and sex. Okay. So this was how up until 2015, she had this 90 or greater, right so then from 2015 to 2017. She was stable in the 80s with a slight decline and then it went In 17, she was sent to an adult CF center. So she's transitioning into adult care where they gave her some IV antibiotics to increase trying to increase her pulmonary function. And so these lung infections are rough, right? Because they basically, in the airways, they get an infection, which causes inflammation and tissue damage, which damages the circulation and allows the infection to get bigger. And so basically, it's a progressive disease where it feeds back on itself, in part because a lot of these virulence factors that are secreted so I'm going to show you a plot of this young woman's, if he wants to help as a proxy for lung function, okay, so she got this iv causton, here in the in January 2017, that she's in the skill center.\n\n","    And then it dipped a little bit. She had a little exacerbation and went down, but she got more IVs. And then it recovered. Right, so this gray bar here is when she's in the hospital.\n\n","    So she got hospitalized the gave her iv causton. She's great. He started declining in when she got out. So as I need to gave her more IV antibiotics, here's a triple combo. So they gave her that during a hospitalization and almost immediately she presented with australium. With CF, okay, that's very common, when you deplete someone's microbiome with all these antibiotics, a lot of times see this, which cause further problems. And then such a partial lung collapse here. Then once she was discharged, she's gradually was improving. So then in October, she had 14 days of IV antibiotics, her lung function continued to decline. And as at this point, that they contacted us about phage because of the resistance profile, and the fact that antibiotics didn't seem to work. So if you look at the section right here, blowing up a little bit, okay, so they pulled back here from her speed. And so she coughed up. And they cultured bacteria out of it, and they quantified it as for us, so these are semi quantitative method, they found more, so that's a very heavy infection. They call to the bacteria and to be resistant all these antibiotics, right? It treated with iv causton and tezo. continued to decline. You can see it was continuing to be resistant. They finished antibiotics and her lung function still was going down, suggesting that it wasn't doing any, hey, we initiated phage therapy right here, it's not a sample of bacteria. So, we had received bacteria for sputum. And I wrote it in a biofilm to test it. So I equate this bacteria in a biofilm and then I treated with either phage H plus antibiotic and aquatic alone just to control I let it sit for 24 hours and I sonicated it out for the bacteria right. So I found that phage alone decreased one order of magnitude bacteria, H plus antibiotic two orders of magnitude and then antibiotic and the control identical, okay, so it helps it doesn't look much on the plot here because a log scale right? But it did kill 90% of the bacteria within 24 hours, okay. So it degraded some biofilm. Alright, so below that is a plot of the MSE of the surviving bacteria. And we found that in the cases where it was exposed to phage at all, it had a seriously decreased micc to about it was even pregnant is that for my son? So this bacteriophage can help degrade biofilms and improve the antibiotic sensitivity of Pseudomonas isolates and clinical isolates too. So, um, so we tested this is I just talked about this, but we saw two orders of magnitude reduction with H plus exposure and then a reduction in antibiotic resistance as well.\n\n","    Right, so we started as I said, Here, we started phage therapy a week, and then we called your battery out and we found increased increased sensitivity so Cipro now intermediate resistance level foxes in intermediate capacity, 17, tezo, and imipenem. It's sensitive. So we've opened up several antibiotics that we can use to treat a chicken came back a couple months, cultured again, sensitive to almost all these antibiotics, also know her lung function once we initiated phage therapy, her lung full jumped up 10% and then it continued to increase back to 80. Okay. So she had a bunch of, you know, responses, she had an increase in nuke split production. She lost her car, she had a little bit of a eight week after he had all this increased energy joined the gym, lung, sun and clear. However, her lungs continue to produce Pseudomonas as you expect them individually, CF. Healthcare is no longer drug resistant. It's been geez almost three years now and her FPV is actually above 90%. Now, she said zero exacerbation sense. So it's kept her in the hospital for years with this great lung function. So it's entirely possible fH really have a strong role here. And so from this case, things went really crazy. And people were all over contacting us about treatment, especially for pulmonary function. So pulmonary infections, specially those with CF. Okay, so she, you know, I often get asked, Oh, is it trade off a replacement because a lot of these lungs, especially cystic fibrosis, it's a really complicated community of many strains of Pseudomonas and other bacteria. And so the question is, often did you just kill the drug resistant ones? And then the drug sensitive ones grew up? Or were you causing some evolution happening inside the lungs? I think it's both actually. The original sputum had multiple phenotypes. Unsurprisingly, unsurprising. But by the end, it was basically a single isolate single strain. However, that's a replacement, strong suggestive of a replacement. However, in the lab, when I take these strains and expose them to phage, I can see a change in MSE to tobramycin. Also, so there's an improvement in sensitivities due to selection. So it's probably both there's a trade off happening as of evolution and lung. There's also a placement of by these less resistant strains are allowed to grow up with the niches opened up. So yeah, now we're way out there, she's got a really high ABV no hospitalizations, notes, so patients, um, so she's doing great. And she's, she's also been in the press quite a bit. She's, she's great, we still hang out there, and we're in touch pretty frequently. And so definitely read up on her case, if you're interested. There's a lot online. Her name is Paige Rogers, so you can watch it below documentaries about her. Um, and so so that really got people excited in the possibility of treating CF infections with with age. Um, so there are several other cases we treated. But after this owner infection that we treated, we basically set up the fH center. I thought I'd take a few minutes here and talk about the H Center. So we have a basic treatment algorithm where we you know, we have people coming in from all across the country or obviously, within Yale health system. With infection treated, we basically identified bacteria in Canada, phage. Syria, we select phage. In device treatment plants, we do an ultra personalized approach, we were very specific on what phages we use and for how long based on lab data, we're doing actual science, where we say, oh, use this page for four days, and then this one for three, and then this combination for another four days, and you have the highest likelihood of doing the bacteria reducing resistance and increasing sensitivity. Or maybe we're targeting virulence to all these things, we select the agent\n\n","    that we deploy the phage, right, so we have them all prepared in in a medically appropriate way. And they're pure enough to be used therapeutically. We treat the individuals and then we monitor changes, right? So a lot of these case reports, they're not doing science, but there's throwing the phage and they're saying, Oh, they got better. It was the page. We're actually monitoring changes. Okay. We have microbiome data for all these lung samples, we're looking at clinical changes in terms of lung function, we're looking at immune response, we're looking at evolution within the lung, we're looking at evolution within the wounds, we're looking at changes in terms of age sensitivity, we're looking at changes in antibiotic sensitivity, obviously, we're looking at changes in the production of these virulence factors during all this, so we really, really well what each page is doing inside the body. Okay. So, when we're selecting phage, we grew up the bacteria, right? And you turn it sensitivity, as I just said, in large Linux spectrums. We talked about this, maybe a few lectures back about determining a sensitivity on it, and then we select the appropriate range. So we have a big library phages at Yale, you know, in the thousands, when and we basically I isolate them constantly from all over the world and we select phages will make all of them but we select pages with relevant clinical and clinically meaning over sectors, right? You're trying to find phages that would make good therapy candidates because not all phages Well, even if phage kills bacteria really well, it might not be a good therapeutic candidate actually increased drug resistance, increase variance, we have to be very careful that we do this properly, or else we can cause disease towards a so we looking at this page for clinically clinically meaningful receptors, for example, antibody, efflux motility, virulence factor production, right? So, for example, let's just look at this page. We talked about a previously made targets antibiotic efflux, right? So you grew up bacteria. Supposing the phage, right, and then you've sequenced the bacteria to come out, and you quantify the number of mutate mutations that occur along the genome. You say, Ah, this guy has a bunch of mutations in efflux. Awesome, it did its job. We have another phage that targets tech for us, which is for motility. involved in motility and some virulence factor production. Actually, you do the same thing grew up the bacteria, explosive phage, select resistant mutants sequence those guys, you see a bunch of mutations in four pillars, exactly as you'd expect.\n\n","    The same thing for trying to reduce inflammation and maybe work synergistically with immune system, we might target the entity, right, so we do the same thing as the previous study. And these mutations are in LPs. Right now we have these three really good pages that we use therapeutically. So let's make a cocktail out of them. Right? Let's just take these three targets, three different virulence factors, pull them together, make a cocktail.\n\n","    The same thing is a cocktail growed up. If the resistant mutants, what do you see?\n\n","    Ah, it's not mutations in anabolic effects pills and MPs, as mutations in the capsule and mismatch repair is exactly what we didn't want. Resistant mutants in this case, are harder to kill by white blood cells, they have increased antibiotic resistance and increased chance of invading new tissues, this is gonna make the disease much worse using this cocktail, right. So what happens if we do it in series? This is my case for serial MonaVie therapy. You are the first page targets and resistant mutants that come out of all these mutations in flux, right? Take the strain, expose it to the next page. Boom, see the mutations in the pelisse. Right, hit it with the last page, we see all the changes in LPs surviving population now has decreased antibiotic resistance, decreased virulence and decreased ability to invade new niches and tissues and increased consumption by white blood cells. Right? So this can work synergistically with the immune system. Obviously, we're not always in a privileged position to to come up with a page cocktail and treat them see. Sorry, come on phages treat in series like this, for all cases, this works in chronic infections with high likelihood of recon ization or reinfection, right? If it's an acute and pen resistant infection that's very severe, you might not have the liberty to do this. And so just throw the cocktail at it, kill off a bunch of bacteria, control inflammation, come back with a new cocktail because your library should have hundreds of different foods, you can always find a new cocktail to use in series.\n\n","    So using this approach of serial monitor phage therapy, I'll talk about few other cases here. Right so this is a 16 year old girl with cystic fibrosis and has lung disease or pulmonary function. And she was experiencing it's pretty severe exacerbation. How does isn't Pseudomonas intervene with phage. Here again, pre and post junk sensitivities are here in the table on the left pod is the same as before and FPV one, so she started off with much lower lung function with some mild increase. But we did see a very rapid reduction of speed of bacteria density, two orders of magnitude reduced. And she returned to her baseline, C reactive protein and white blood cells after a week so suggesting that the phage intervention had helped with inflammation. Alright, so a couple more cases here so we treated a 26 year old woman with CF Same as before and resistance to monus. In her case, we were looking for a way that we can be open sensitivity to meropenem. So treated her here. You can see this plot is the green line is when based therapies and used in the pre therapy so I've had the privilege of getting sputum before treatment. quantified bacteria didn't see a change in speed and density. We asked phage and immediately saw a big reduction of Pseudomonas. In this case, it looks like nearly three orders of magnitude. And then the bacteria that grew out of that were sensitive to meropenem again, so she was able to get out of hospital. She's also been in the media quite a bit. My name's Ella. You can Google Ella Lhasa, and you'll see all about her story. But she actually stayed out of the hospital for quite a while with this benefit from page, all right case, blow this is an elderly gentleman with COPD and a massive lung abscess requiring surgical intervention. But the surgeons wouldn't touch the case because, you know, massive abscess and there was a big risk of opening them up the infection spread. So they had retweeted this guy with phage. And we have a pre age density of 10 to the six PS CFS per mil, we treated with the only antibiotic was sensitive to and actually, on the day we treated with phage. It was toward the end of that course of antibiotics and his bacterial load actually had gone up two orders of magnitude. We started with phage and immediately saw a big reduction in bacteria density, almost four orders of magnitude and re sensitization that America and he saw some improvement on imaging to the point where surgeons would once again consider the case for removal of abscess.\n\n","    Okay, just a couple more quick ones here with another non CF bronchiectasis this man was injured in a house fire with a lot of smoke 40 years ago, and then had a chronic lung lung infections ever since because a lung tissue was damaged. So his Pseudomonas was resistant to every chemical on ionic, even those in trials. And so he came to us about age, which he did this individual ice. So the first case here on the applaud this the first green section, we saw a big reduction of\n\n","    speed of density and bacteria, three orders of magnitude reduction.\n\n","    And then we treated him again a couple months later, and we saw another reduction of bacteria to the point of where it's below limit detection by the lab and this was a 16 year infection that is eradicated it's important to say that you see the two cultures here on the left. Um, that's the color of the bacteria before treatment and after treatment CCNA reduction of the production of Prasanna which is which is one of virulence factors talked about earlier in this lecture. So we actually made a prediction in the lab of what would happen, I created a visual saw what happened on the on the on the back end of that and actually matched our prediction. Okay, k seven down here is a 38 year old woman with CF. panners isn't Pseudomonas. Again, same stories before we treated with phage targeting pls, which was involved in Prasanna production, we saw an immediate reduction, two orders of magnitude reduction speed and density bacteria. And then we saw an improvement to separate floxin. So she could use that again, and a little bit of an improvement in FPV. One, you see the plates below here are actually agency sensitivity plates we took to some of our top phages. before, during and after phage therapy so the top is before things or screen during therapy is less screen and then after that, if you see three strains that we pulled that were completely devoid, so it's exactly as we would have predicted would have happened.\n\n","    Okay, so just some quick conclusions about this. This least with the with the work we're doing at Yale is that face can force clinically meaningful trade offs in vitro. Okay, lab essays can inform clinical decisions, especially regarding environment selection, we can work with clinicians to identify which pages will work best with certain antibiotics to optimize treatment, okay. Next bring phage treatment, they can be deployed safely and effectively seen zero severe adverse events, no bronchospasm nothing. And they can be deployed effectively to treat these infections, changes in bacterial community during phage therapy can be potentially predicted based on lab essays and CNN with inflammation with drug flux, we can make a prediction and it looks like it works to people. Okay. So, terms of outcome, clinically, clinically meaningful trade offs can be forced in vivo, right? So we can cause bacteria to be drug sensitive again, and cause them to stop producing some of these virulence factors. Okay, so changes in status, therefore, like in terms of improvement, maybe improve lung function, health can be attributed to a phage based intervention. However, in the absence of placebo controlled clinical trials, we can't definitively make that claim. We have a clinical trial that by the time this airs We started, we received permission from FDA to start, we're just finishing manufacturing today. That trial world isn't cystic fibrosis, we're going to work there. And we have two trials planned every year after that. And we're going to be working in different bacteria, different diseases. But until we get these clinical trials up and running, we can't make any claims. So this is where I would normally take questions. However, I obviously can't message me, but you can through email. It's been like every one of my lectures, or Instagram. This is a picture of some of the people in the lab, and then a Venn diagram of a center Gail, where we involve education of med students, grad students, clinical lab scientists, doing actual scientific research on the medical side, clinical trial research, we're doing bench science, and then we're actually doing clinical trials and clinical research. So with that, I think I'm gonna jump to some other\n\n","    topics at another time. But again, if you have any questions, feel free to email me and pretty quickly replying\n\n","    \n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["73287f3c-b49a-4300-9030-49985548978b"],"content":[{"id":"73287f3c-b49a-4300-9030-49985548978b","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"c51e6ef3-5944-458f-8faa-5156e0b14ae3","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:01\n\n","    All right, so now let's talk about some of these cases. Right. And in order to get to the national cases, I thought we'd start off talking about\n\n","    involved.\n\n","    And just for, you know, example, we'll talk about Pseudomonas, because this is bacteria that said, spend\n\n","    So if you look at these effects, mumps and Pseudomonas called, most of them are Mac's, which that's multi response. And then they're named like max AB, okay, so that just has to deal with Max's multidrug efflux, and then a B would be the inner and transmembrane protein names. And then OPR is our membrane protein and then so other name so that they existed before chemical antibiotics were developed by humans, they, they do pump them out, and to pump out solvents, dyes, biocides cell signaling molecules, they're just great stuff. So no, factory, sorry, material kicks in and out of otic, but they recognize it.\n\n","    And of these six, four of them use the same outer membrane component OPR, as you can see here with this red letters,\n\n","    and these pumps, at least the OPR m gene is under stabilizing selection. This gentleman here in the lower left corner is named Mark sistrum. He works for me as an assistant professor at University of California, Merced said, and he analyzed genomes of all published Pseudomonas, specifically looking at remembering protein M. and found this under strong stabilizing selection, which means is highly conserved. So it's very similar in Pseudomonas, you pull from sewer versus UTI versus plant infection, all using the same OPR.\n\n","    And, you know, some of our earlier work showed that we tested a bunch of isolates from all over sewage, you know, infections, UTI, dog ear infections that were sensitive to the phage. And we tested the MRC. So that's the minimum inhibitory concentration of several antibiotics in three different groups broadly, those that efflux provides resistance, those that effects may provide resistance or provide some resistance, and then those three folks does not provide resistance. Right. So you'll see here in third column the MSE of\n\n","    these bacteria to these\n\n","    antibiotics. We then exposed it to phage on cat one and pulled resistant colonies from where we grew up those resistant bacteria tested MIT again and we got the following results right. So, we have a reduction of micc in the ones where effects provide resistance, big reduction, medium reduction in those where effects make fragile sense and no change where you know, existence okay. So, in several of these actually showed reversion from clinical resistance to susceptibility Alright, so, to confirm this receptor, and this is the this sort of work is stuff that you can do for like, all phages that just those using these, you know, remember, this, I mean, should probably do for all the phages discovery, you should at least know the receptor stability, its genomes, you know, all these things, right. So, just as an assembler determinant, we used a transpose on knockout we tense so basically a transposable element is inserted in, in the genes. So in this, we test it against one where transposons inserted in the atom every m gene. And we also tested this max R, which is the repressor of C flux system. So, for these e flux xenobiotics, the wild type is resistant, the knockout had a increased sensitivity. And then the repressor one is knocked out as a is still resistant, as you would expect. Something which is not a fluxed. That unchanged. We then tested face sensitivity and found that it was at the oprf knockout was resistant to facial hair culture sensitive,\n\n","    perfect strongly suggest that's the receptor. So we did this over time also with a reader. So the Y, I'm going to show you a plot here where the y axis is cell density as measured by od 600. And then time across the x eight, so when so should be color coordinated here. But you look at the wild type with ethos capable in the presence of subinhibitory\n\n","    Okay, so now let's jump way back to another section of lectures when I was talking about the very first case, right, so this is the case of the aortic aneurysm. We talked about that lectures ago. I told you we get back to it. Now the point we're getting back to\n\n","    Getting reagents that grew up resistant to the phage and we tested the MRC again, and we saw a big decrease in Cipro, gentamicin tobramycin. And also some testing. As we saw a general improvement in bio sensitivities of black bars in Cipro, gentamicin and Bryson represent clinical breakpoints for these drugs. So what we saw is reversion from clinical resistance to sensitivity to these drugs, simply by involves page resistance.\n\n","    So I took the data to the surgeons and they were like, awesome, this is what we need to do. Let's treat this guy, right. So you know if you're going to develop a therapy, this is like basic identifying like you have it's therapy. You sample you tested sensitivity of the bacteria isolate seven\n\n","    strains ideally, in a well characterized library, grow up the phage, concentrate, phage endotoxin, and EXO toxins dialyze it, you know, contaminants, prepare to doses and then confirm the low endotoxin concentration, and then you should be ready to go. Right. So I realized I say it like it's some simple tasks, means one of the steps requires a lot of work. But it's certainly something can be done in most labs.\n\n","    Well, that was not possible. So we tried doing this for three hours in the theater, and we were unable to puncture this, this little collection of fluid, do heavy scarring. So you know, it like obsessed and like, walled off, and it was scarring.\n\n","    So we did that and discharged him four weeks post procedure, he developed a bunch of bleeding from that fistula, and, you know, very concerning, right, because you're like, Oh, my God, the,\n\n","    because of this illness, where the physicians there, identify that pinkeye, pseudocyst and drain so they saw these little systems as they drained them, and they pulled us into the vector bahmani. Right. So they stabilized in there with some antibiotics. And then they flew him to California for treatment. And by time he ended up in California, this bug was actually Pandora resistant, which means is resistant to the available chemical antibiotics.\n\n","    So this point, they started working on a potential phage treatment. And they just were administered for eight weeks, I believe, 16 weeks, sorry, 16 weeks via washing the abscess areas and by IP. Let me see what goes on there. What they gave.\n\n","    They were also this guy was also given several endo biotics via IV vancomycin meropenem cost into cycling. And they also added azithromycin on day 36 of his treatment. This is combination of work between several groups went to Texas, the Navy, California\n\n","    And the bottom blue line, there is the duration of IV therapy with phage. Right, and the pots on the right are growth charts similar to the one I showed you previously.\n\n","    It's similar to this right, so similar optical density over time, this is using a proprietary technology by one of the authors on the paper, that is functionally the equivalent\n\n","    So with this case, they also were able to pull blood samples because the guy was admitted in hospital. So it's pretty straightforward, the easy blood. And they found that faders were actually readily removed from serum. So you know, they took control minus five minutes, five minutes, 30 minutes, 6183 60. And then they pulled blood, and they quantified age. And they found you know, before face every there's no age, see, in five minutes, they had one point 10 fourth pfds per mil,\n\n","    by 30 minutes, it was down to four times in a third an hour, it was almost undetectable, and one. So within an hour they're gone from. And also importantly, is that serum collected at the end of the study showed neutralizing antibodies. So they basically found that the antibody immune system had recognized the phages in the cocktail and would kill them. So this is by the end of the study. I don't know if it determined the point at which this happened. But by 16 weeks, it was resistant. By day eight, the blood cultures were all resistant to the phages test as far as I understand. But they continued using IV phage. In case there was some there were still sensitive. Following 16 weeks of fake treatment, including a six week coma, he just woke up one day. And he's been working ever since he looks great. He's out talking. You can Google him, he's he's a very nice guy. And you can read all about it, hear all about it on YouTube, with his wife on the left, she's written a book about it. And you can find this on Google. And so that's that's the case in California. So after that case, we ended up creating quite a few pulmonary cases. So because of a press from that case, and in our prior one, we started getting contacted by a bunch of individuals or physicians with cases that they were treating or their sub selves and family members with infections that they were looking for alternatives because the cases I'm about to tell you are, are of those flavors. This one we'll call case was a young woman with cystic fibrosis. So it's a genetic disease that results in, you know, thick mucus production, and they are prone to pulmonary infections. So in this case, right here, this woman had chronic pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa that's, you know, that's a very, very common bacteria in cystic fibrosis, okay. So she historically had a baseline febe one, which is the forced expiratory volume of air that individuals breathe out at one second\n\n","    of 90%. So that just means that she had 90% lung function of someone without CF of her age and sex. Okay. So this was how up until 2015, she had this 90 or greater, right so then from 2015 to 2017. She was stable in the 80s with a slight decline and then it went In 17, she was sent to an adult CF center. So she's transitioning into adult care where they gave her some IV antibiotics to increase trying to increase her pulmonary function. And so these lung infections are rough, right? Because they basically, in the airways, they get an infection, which causes inflammation and tissue damage, which damages the circulation and allows the infection to get bigger. And so basically, it's a progressive disease where it feeds back on itself, in part because a lot of these virulence factors that are secreted so I'm going to show you a plot of this young woman's, if he wants to help as a proxy for lung function, okay, so she got this iv causton, here in the in January 2017, that she's in the skill center.\n\n","    And then it dipped a little bit. She had a little exacerbation and went down, but she got more IVs. And then it recovered. Right, so this gray bar here is when she's in the hospital.\n\n","    So she got hospitalized the gave her iv causton. She's great. He started declining in when she got out. So as I need to gave her more IV antibiotics, here's a triple combo. So they gave her that during a hospitalization and almost immediately she presented with australium. With CF, okay, that's very common, when you deplete someone's microbiome with all these antibiotics, a lot of times see this, which cause further problems. And then such a partial lung collapse here. Then once she was discharged, she's gradually was improving. So then in October, she had 14 days of IV antibiotics, her lung function continued to decline. And as at this point, that they contacted us about phage because of the resistance profile, and the fact that antibiotics didn't seem to work. So if you look at the section right here, blowing up a little bit, okay, so they pulled back here from her speed. And so she coughed up. And they cultured bacteria out of it, and they quantified it as for us, so these are semi quantitative method, they found more, so that's a very heavy infection. They call to the bacteria and to be resistant all these antibiotics, right? It treated with iv causton and tezo. continued to decline. You can see it was continuing to be resistant. They finished antibiotics and her lung function still was going down, suggesting that it wasn't doing any, hey, we initiated phage therapy right here, it's not a sample of bacteria. So, we had received bacteria for sputum. And I wrote it in a biofilm to test it. So I equate this bacteria in a biofilm and then I treated with either phage H plus antibiotic and aquatic alone just to control I let it sit for 24 hours and I sonicated it out for the bacteria right. So I found that phage alone decreased one order of magnitude bacteria, H plus antibiotic two orders of magnitude and then antibiotic and the control identical, okay, so it helps it doesn't look much on the plot here because a log scale right? But it did kill 90% of the bacteria within 24 hours, okay. So it degraded some biofilm. Alright, so below that is a plot of the MSE of the surviving bacteria. And we found that in the cases where it was exposed to phage at all, it had a seriously decreased micc to about it was even pregnant is that for my son? So this bacteriophage can help degrade biofilms and improve the antibiotic sensitivity of Pseudomonas isolates and clinical isolates too. So, um, so we tested this is I just talked about this, but we saw two orders of magnitude reduction with H plus exposure and then a reduction in antibiotic resistance as well.\n\n","    Right, so we started as I said, Here, we started phage therapy a week, and then we called your battery out and we found increased increased sensitivity so Cipro now intermediate resistance level foxes in intermediate capacity, 17, tezo, and imipenem. It's sensitive. So we've opened up several antibiotics that we can use to treat a chicken came back a couple months, cultured again, sensitive to almost all these antibiotics, also know her lung function once we initiated phage therapy, her lung full jumped up 10% and then it continued to increase back to 80. Okay. So she had a bunch of, you know, responses, she had an increase in nuke split production. She lost her car, she had a little bit of a eight week after he had all this increased energy joined the gym, lung, sun and clear. However, her lungs continue to produce Pseudomonas as you expect them individually, CF. Healthcare is no longer drug resistant. It's been geez almost three years now and her FPV is actually above 90%. Now, she said zero exacerbation sense. So it's kept her in the hospital for years with this great lung function. So it's entirely possible fH really have a strong role here. And so from this case, things went really crazy. And people were all over contacting us about treatment, especially for pulmonary function. So pulmonary infections, specially those with CF. Okay, so she, you know, I often get asked, Oh, is it trade off a replacement because a lot of these lungs, especially cystic fibrosis, it's a really complicated community of many strains of Pseudomonas and other bacteria. And so the question is, often did you just kill the drug resistant ones? And then the drug sensitive ones grew up? Or were you causing some evolution happening inside the lungs? I think it's both actually. The original sputum had multiple phenotypes. Unsurprisingly, unsurprising. But by the end, it was basically a single isolate single strain. However, that's a replacement, strong suggestive of a replacement. However, in the lab, when I take these strains and expose them to phage, I can see a change in MSE to tobramycin. Also, so there's an improvement in sensitivities due to selection. So it's probably both there's a trade off happening as of evolution and lung. There's also a placement of by these less resistant strains are allowed to grow up with the niches opened up. So yeah, now we're way out there, she's got a really high ABV no hospitalizations, notes, so patients, um, so she's doing great. And she's, she's also been in the press quite a bit. She's, she's great, we still hang out there, and we're in touch pretty frequently. And so definitely read up on her case, if you're interested. There's a lot online. Her name is Paige Rogers, so you can watch it below documentaries about her. Um, and so so that really got people excited in the possibility of treating CF infections with with age. Um, so there are several other cases we treated. But after this owner infection that we treated, we basically set up the fH center. I thought I'd take a few minutes here and talk about the H Center. So we have a basic treatment algorithm where we you know, we have people coming in from all across the country or obviously, within Yale health system. With infection treated, we basically identified bacteria in Canada, phage. Syria, we select phage. In device treatment plants, we do an ultra personalized approach, we were very specific on what phages we use and for how long based on lab data, we're doing actual science, where we say, oh, use this page for four days, and then this one for three, and then this combination for another four days, and you have the highest likelihood of doing the bacteria reducing resistance and increasing sensitivity. Or maybe we're targeting virulence to all these things, we select the agent\n\n","    that we deploy the phage, right, so we have them all prepared in in a medically appropriate way. And they're pure enough to be used therapeutically. We treat the individuals and then we monitor changes, right? So a lot of these case reports, they're not doing science, but there's throwing the phage and they're saying, Oh, they got better. It was the page. We're actually monitoring changes. Okay. We have microbiome data for all these lung samples, we're looking at clinical changes in terms of lung function, we're looking at immune response, we're looking at evolution within the lung, we're looking at evolution within the wounds, we're looking at changes in terms of age sensitivity, we're looking at changes in antibiotic sensitivity, obviously, we're looking at changes in the production of these virulence factors during all this, so we really, really well what each page is doing inside the body. Okay. So, when we're selecting phage, we grew up the bacteria, right? And you turn it sensitivity, as I just said, in large Linux spectrums. We talked about this, maybe a few lectures back about determining a sensitivity on it, and then we select the appropriate range. So we have a big library phages at Yale, you know, in the thousands, when and we basically I isolate them constantly from all over the world and we select phages will make all of them but we select pages with relevant clinical and clinically meaning over sectors, right? You're trying to find phages that would make good therapy candidates because not all phages Well, even if phage kills bacteria really well, it might not be a good therapeutic candidate actually increased drug resistance, increase variance, we have to be very careful that we do this properly, or else we can cause disease towards a so we looking at this page for clinically clinically meaningful receptors, for example, antibody, efflux motility, virulence factor production, right? So, for example, let's just look at this page. We talked about a previously made targets antibiotic efflux, right? So you grew up bacteria. Supposing the phage, right, and then you've sequenced the bacteria to come out, and you quantify the number of mutate mutations that occur along the genome. You say, Ah, this guy has a bunch of mutations in efflux. Awesome, it did its job. We have another phage that targets tech for us, which is for motility. involved in motility and some virulence factor production. Actually, you do the same thing grew up the bacteria, explosive phage, select resistant mutants sequence those guys, you see a bunch of mutations in four pillars, exactly as you'd expect.\n\n","    The same thing for trying to reduce inflammation and maybe work synergistically with immune system, we might target the entity, right, so we do the same thing as the previous study. And these mutations are in LPs. Right now we have these three really good pages that we use therapeutically. So let's make a cocktail out of them. Right? Let's just take these three targets, three different virulence factors, pull them together, make a cocktail.\n\n","    The same thing is a cocktail growed up. If the resistant mutants, what do you see?\n\n","    Ah, it's not mutations in anabolic effects pills and MPs, as mutations in the capsule and mismatch repair is exactly what we didn't want. Resistant mutants in this case, are harder to kill by white blood cells, they have increased antibiotic resistance and increased chance of invading new tissues, this is gonna make the disease much worse using this cocktail, right. So what happens if we do it in series? This is my case for serial MonaVie therapy. You are the first page targets and resistant mutants that come out of all these mutations in flux, right? Take the strain, expose it to the next page. Boom, see the mutations in the pelisse. Right, hit it with the last page, we see all the changes in LPs surviving population now has decreased antibiotic resistance, decreased virulence and decreased ability to invade new niches and tissues and increased consumption by white blood cells. Right? So this can work synergistically with the immune system. Obviously, we're not always in a privileged position to to come up with a page cocktail and treat them see. Sorry, come on phages treat in series like this, for all cases, this works in chronic infections with high likelihood of recon ization or reinfection, right? If it's an acute and pen resistant infection that's very severe, you might not have the liberty to do this. And so just throw the cocktail at it, kill off a bunch of bacteria, control inflammation, come back with a new cocktail because your library should have hundreds of different foods, you can always find a new cocktail to use in series.\n\n","    So using this approach of serial monitor phage therapy, I'll talk about few other cases here. Right so this is a 16 year old girl with cystic fibrosis and has lung disease or pulmonary function. And she was experiencing it's pretty severe exacerbation. How does isn't Pseudomonas intervene with phage. Here again, pre and post junk sensitivities are here in the table on the left pod is the same as before and FPV one, so she started off with much lower lung function with some mild increase. But we did see a very rapid reduction of speed of bacteria density, two orders of magnitude reduced. And she returned to her baseline, C reactive protein and white blood cells after a week so suggesting that the phage intervention had helped with inflammation. Alright, so a couple more cases here so we treated a 26 year old woman with CF Same as before and resistance to monus. In her case, we were looking for a way that we can be open sensitivity to meropenem. So treated her here. You can see this plot is the green line is when based therapies and used in the pre therapy so I've had the privilege of getting sputum before treatment. quantified bacteria didn't see a change in speed and density. We asked phage and immediately saw a big reduction of Pseudomonas. In this case, it looks like nearly three orders of magnitude. And then the bacteria that grew out of that were sensitive to meropenem again, so she was able to get out of hospital. She's also been in the media quite a bit. My name's Ella. You can Google Ella Lhasa, and you'll see all about her story. But she actually stayed out of the hospital for quite a while with this benefit from page, all right case, blow this is an elderly gentleman with COPD and a massive lung abscess requiring surgical intervention. But the surgeons wouldn't touch the case because, you know, massive abscess and there was a big risk of opening them up the infection spread. So they had retweeted this guy with phage. And we have a pre age density of 10 to the six PS CFS per mil, we treated with the only antibiotic was sensitive to and actually, on the day we treated with phage. It was toward the end of that course of antibiotics and his bacterial load actually had gone up two orders of magnitude. We started with phage and immediately saw a big reduction in bacteria density, almost four orders of magnitude and re sensitization that America and he saw some improvement on imaging to the point where surgeons would once again consider the case for removal of abscess.\n\n","    Okay, just a couple more quick ones here with another non CF bronchiectasis this man was injured in a house fire with a lot of smoke 40 years ago, and then had a chronic lung lung infections ever since because a lung tissue was damaged. So his Pseudomonas was resistant to every chemical on ionic, even those in trials. And so he came to us about age, which he did this individual ice. So the first case here on the applaud this the first green section, we saw a big reduction of\n\n","    speed of density and bacteria, three orders of magnitude reduction.\n\n","    And then we treated him again a couple months later, and we saw another reduction of bacteria to the point of where it's below limit detection by the lab and this was a 16 year infection that is eradicated it's important to say that you see the two cultures here on the left. Um, that's the color of the bacteria before treatment and after treatment CCNA reduction of the production of Prasanna which is which is one of virulence factors talked about earlier in this lecture. So we actually made a prediction in the lab of what would happen, I created a visual saw what happened on the on the on the back end of that and actually matched our prediction. Okay, k seven down here is a 38 year old woman with CF. panners isn't Pseudomonas. Again, same stories before we treated with phage targeting pls, which was involved in Prasanna production, we saw an immediate reduction, two orders of magnitude reduction speed and density bacteria. And then we saw an improvement to separate floxin. So she could use that again, and a little bit of an improvement in FPV. One, you see the plates below here are actually agency sensitivity plates we took to some of our top phages. before, during and after phage therapy so the top is before things or screen during therapy is less screen and then after that, if you see three strains that we pulled that were completely devoid, so it's exactly as we would have predicted would have happened.\n\n","    Okay, so just some quick conclusions about this. This least with the with the work we're doing at Yale is that face can force clinically meaningful trade offs in vitro. Okay, lab essays can inform clinical decisions, especially regarding environment selection, we can work with clinicians to identify which pages will work best with certain antibiotics to optimize treatment, okay. Next bring phage treatment, they can be deployed safely and effectively seen zero severe adverse events, no bronchospasm nothing. And they can be deployed effectively to treat these infections, changes in bacterial community during phage therapy can be potentially predicted based on lab essays and CNN with inflammation with drug flux, we can make a prediction and it looks like it works to people. Okay. So, terms of outcome, clinically, clinically meaningful trade offs can be forced in vivo, right? So we can cause bacteria to be drug sensitive again, and cause them to stop producing some of these virulence factors. Okay, so changes in status, therefore, like in terms of improvement, maybe improve lung function, health can be attributed to a phage based intervention. However, in the absence of placebo controlled clinical trials, we can't definitively make that claim. We have a clinical trial that by the time this airs We started, we received permission from FDA to start, we're just finishing manufacturing today. That trial world isn't cystic fibrosis, we're going to work there. And we have two trials planned every year after that. And we're going to be working in different bacteria, different diseases. But until we get these clinical trials up and running, we can't make any claims. So this is where I would normally take questions. However, I obviously can't message me, but you can through email. It's been like every one of my lectures, or Instagram. This is a picture of some of the people in the lab, and then a Venn diagram of a center Gail, where we involve education of med students, grad students, clinical lab scientists, doing actual scientific research on the medical side, clinical trial research, we're doing bench science, and then we're actually doing clinical trials and clinical research. So with that, I think I'm gonna jump to some other\n\n","    topics at another time. But again, if you have any questions, feel free to email me and pretty quickly replying\n\n","    \n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["c1b1d6e2-02fa-4d06-90db-0dd4358bf050","f409d7ee-a516-46a2-ad62-44b2bcb16693","e4cff1cc-8d78-4178-93d7-c75b4b2eefee","16bbf568-05c4-44ef-86cf-532b76deb799","2695c3c9-ddbf-4aed-b8c9-6ae40846c84e","bc691200-f4b8-4ce8-913b-f69d4f53ad6c","52753ae3-c332-4bdc-aed8-9dce0b0fcbf4","fa838f9d-ac06-4087-861c-c985a5f8fc57","cfdf20e7-862f-4922-81ea-f60e8e4875b2","f903dcd7-4ff6-4b27-ab77-99c2f38c206b","aa7c63c5-bfb3-4a68-8916-8a5e4cf61446","9a0875d1-7a1a-4be7-a447-d673364de132","5bf84891-b653-4f43-907b-382251ccf77a","3d053606-6a45-487a-bf4c-37af48020850","9c41e3df-b250-4816-9176-4e8db56dc6f4","7e08b402-73f6-466b-9d09-6c55dfc73ee1","bd88ea67-c4bc-46f8-b206-d1a67c77cdae","13b899bf-4483-4c3d-8a01-5d37f5fec637","3575f11f-903d-431a-8505-ffc88db0371f","1e049c53-2ed1-4e1b-92ae-cfa2f74a088b","573cca7d-b353-46f5-9db2-538cb43334dc","684fd073-d7f3-4310-ba05-0e1f94a3a11c","923aea26-ad01-464e-a498-d0995bd528f0","e751df13-9f86-4bbf-8b0e-c007dcdc0a37","66b3c9ab-3d93-412c-9aed-b507801fabb0","3b39cb7f-6af5-433b-9aa3-aecf6712e3b1","73905677-08c4-4d84-92a9-89d251278f33","106ab2a4-70c1-4472-9d9b-26d3be97efae","55dc1b7a-d75c-4d65-96fb-045d9f7549d4","28d759ad-de20-4a12-861d-af482b6c3e57","e5a25c98-c256-4d4d-a845-c337b11ecf84","717bd3ae-b9fd-4bce-b0dc-80c2dbb95f0e","ddca5530-cc57-4518-8d14-abc8041d8cab","53d93e72-0f10-4690-8eaa-cf63248ee1d4","7cdaa4ee-1d34-4b0e-818a-d1fb7def2bb0","733e4bab-cdf2-48cc-bdf5-2d64305ff752","75fac3b2-0b50-4b3d-bffa-8a35c3ff5dcb","411cb06c-524e-407e-8b8c-6dc900bf1dfb","02ec2c8d-ec94-43d8-bd48-8ffa47a57212"],"content":[{"id":"c1b1d6e2-02fa-4d06-90db-0dd4358bf050","type":"text","value":"Ben Chan 0:01","properties":{"title":[["Ben Chan 0:01"]]},"parent_id":"73287f3c-b49a-4300-9030-49985548978b","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Ben Chan 0:01\n\n"]},{"id":"f409d7ee-a516-46a2-ad62-44b2bcb16693","type":"text","value":"All right, so now let's talk about some of these cases.

I am Dr. Shawna MacAllan. And I am a phage and clinical researcher here at the bogus University Hospital in Zurich. And I'm happy to be one of the lecturers in this online course series for phages. And today we're going to be talking about my favorite topic, which are clinical trials for phage therapy. And to start off with, I'd like to ask you a question. And that is, why would you take this medicine? So here you can see it's a bottle of aspirin, it's probably something that we've all come across and needed in our lifetimes and anti inflammatory and it's commonplace everywhere, across the world. So if you've answered yes to this question, I want to ask you, would you take this medicine, this is the Pio bacteriophage cocktail produced by elliana in Tbilisi, Georgia. So it is a registered medicine or product in Georgia, and it's sold as an over the counter medicine in the pharmacy. And when you look at these two different products, start to think about what makes you say, Okay, I'll take a pill of aspirin, and maybe might make you hesitate before you would take Pio bacteria phages. And that's really what we want to go through today is to look at why we do clinical trials, because this is what we need in order to bring a product to market.\n\n","    And in order to understand why we do them,\n\n","    we're going to have to briefly look at how they came about through history and where this idea of performing experiments on humans, rather than a test tube or on animals came about.\n\n","    Then we'll move on to when we do a\n\n","    clinical trial, what are the main different parts of a clinical study, before we actually move into the modern trials for phage therapy that have been performed to date. And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics. And in order to understand why we do clinical trials, it's really useful that we look at how drug development occurs. So a lot of what we think about for phage therapy phage experiments is really more this discovery phase where we have a great idea or a problem that needs solving. And we look at this problem or interesting idea through basic research, to in vitro tests in vivo tests. And we usually do this at the university or institutional level. But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.\n\n","    And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations. And depending on where you want to use that drug, you should can take into consideration what the local regulatory authorities are. And Tanzania, which is where we did our last in person lecture series was really impressive, because Tanzania is the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning and regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the w h o. And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market. So they control the access in of drugs into the market. But they also make sure that the drugs that are there are still functioning and safe. And they're still post surveillance studies that are performed even once a drug has a regulatory authorization. And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant. There is another few issues actually that have to do with introducing bias into the way that they structured this investigation is that there was no randomization. So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time. And lastly, but not all. One of the other issues is that this investigation was not blinded. So normally with a clinical trial, we really try not to know, either from the perspective of the patient, or if the treating physician what your patient is actually receiving if they're getting a placebo or the standard of care, or if they're getting the investigational product.\n\n","    And this is ultimately because we have a tendency to introduce biases, maybe you could treat a patient better than another or some way differently if you knew what you were giving them within the clinical trial. And this could really bias your results. Now, where clinical trials really developed was out of, you know, the devastation of World War Two. So this was, unfortunately, during this time, with the Nazi occupation, Nazi concentration camps, there was extreme inhumane experimentation performed on humans. And this really led to the development of ethical codes for how we have to work with patients, ethically, to ensure their dignity, and their well being and their freedom of choice. So this led to a variety of different legislations that have been adopted in various forums across the world, notably the Nuremberg Code, and the Helsinki declaration, that has really improved the way that we treat patients that are part of clinical trials. And overall, what this has led to is that when you perform a clinical trial, not only do you have to have the ethical committee or the regulatory authorities involved, you also to have to have an ethical Committee, which will look at the structure of your study, and possibly do some monitoring of the study to ensure that the patients are treated the way that they should be. And they're, they're ethically treated. And this also means that when we involve any type of human subjects in clinical research, where we make sure that we get informed consent, so that they are aware of what the study is, what they could happen to them, and that they have the right to withdrawal from the study at any point in time, for any reason. And there's also the idea that now patients as well, we have to go to great lengths to anonymize their data and protect their privacy.\n\n","    So really,\n\n","    as time goes on, we see a progression of clinical trials and how we did them. And one of the first randomized clinical trials, or the first actually comes from 1948. And in line with phage therapy, this also also has to do with bacterial infections. And so the first randomized clinical trial was actually investigating the use of structure myosin, to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and this was published in the British Medical Journal. And it was really, really remarkable because through this trial, they were able to show that when you treated with that strep demise, and only 7% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis die, whereas without step two minds and almost one third or 20% of the control patients, they they passed away. So again, that idea of introducing randomization is a way to reduce bias in your clinical trial and to have a greater trust in the data that you produce. So this concludes the first section and I will pick back up with you shortly where we look into the next sections of clinical trials for phage therapy.

I am Dr. Shawna MacAllan. And I am a phage and clinical researcher here at the bogus University Hospital in Zurich. And I'm happy to be one of the lecturers in this online course series for phages. And today we're going to be talking about my favorite topic, which are clinical trials for phage therapy. And to start off with, I'd like to ask you a question. And that is, why would you take this medicine? So here you can see it's a bottle of aspirin, it's probably something that we've all come across and needed in our lifetimes and anti inflammatory and it's commonplace everywhere, across the world. So if you've answered yes to this question, I want to ask you, would you take this medicine, this is the Pio bacteriophage cocktail produced by elliana in Tbilisi, Georgia. So it is a registered medicine or product in Georgia, and it's sold as an over the counter medicine in the pharmacy. And when you look at these two different products, start to think about what makes you say, Okay, I'll take a pill of aspirin, and maybe might make you hesitate before you would take Pio bacteria phages. And that's really what we want to go through today is to look at why we do clinical trials, because this is what we need in order to bring a product to market.\n\n","    And in order to understand why we do them,\n\n","    we're going to have to briefly look at how they came about through history and where this idea of performing experiments on humans, rather than a test tube or on animals came about.\n\n","    Then we'll move on to when we do a\n\n","    clinical trial, what are the main different parts of a clinical study, before we actually move into the modern trials for phage therapy that have been performed to date. And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics. And in order to understand why we do clinical trials, it's really useful that we look at how drug development occurs. So a lot of what we think about for phage therapy phage experiments is really more this discovery phase where we have a great idea or a problem that needs solving. And we look at this problem or interesting idea through basic research, to in vitro tests in vivo tests. And we usually do this at the university or institutional level. But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.\n\n","    And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations. And depending on where you want to use that drug, you should can take into consideration what the local regulatory authorities are. And Tanzania, which is where we did our last in person lecture series was really impressive, because Tanzania is the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning and regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the w h o. And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market. So they control the access in of drugs into the market. But they also make sure that the drugs that are there are still functioning and safe. And they're still post surveillance studies that are performed even once a drug has a regulatory authorization. And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant.

And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.\n\n"]},{"id":"03d62a57-796e-4b4b-9a1d-2576d6f997cb","type":"text","value":"And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations. And depending on where you want to use that drug, you should can take into consideration what the local regulatory authorities are. And Tanzania, which is where we did our last in person lecture series was really impressive, because Tanzania is the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning and regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the w h o. And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market. So they control the access in of drugs into the market. But they also make sure that the drugs that are there are still functioning and safe. And they're still post surveillance studies that are performed even once a drug has a regulatory authorization. And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant. There is another few issues actually that have to do with introducing bias into the way that they structured this investigation is that there was no randomization. So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time. And lastly, but not all. One of the other issues is that this investigation was not blinded. So normally with a clinical trial, we really try not to know, either from the perspective of the patient, or if the treating physician what your patient is actually receiving if they're getting a placebo or the standard of care, or if they're getting the investigational product.","properties":{"title":[["And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations.

And we are back for the second segment of this lecture on clinical trials for phage therapy. And we've just gotten done, speaking about the first parts of why we do clinical trials and also about some of the historical events that have really shaped clinical research today. Now, I'd like to move on and show you some of the main parts of a clinical study, because clinical research is quite different than what we're used to doing in a lab per se. So one of the things is that\n\n","    you have\n\n","    to first define your research question. And the idea is you have a research question in order to address a problem or missing piece of information and afield. So, particularly for phage therapy, our problem is really dealing with antibiotic resistance, or treatment failures for infectious disease. And then with the research question, we want to be able to test a possible solution. And in our case, this is bacteria phages. So an example of a research question would be something like can bacteriophages treat urinary tract infections, infections caused by multi drug resistant bacteria. And we'll see that even this is a little bit broad, and you should start with an idea like this, and then make it even more finer. finer is one of those great acronyms we use to try to guide and structure our research question. So find R stands for F meaning feasible, I meaning interesting, and being novel, ie ethical, we saw earlier that that's very important. And our that is relevant. So you can go through after you've come up with a research question to make sure it kind of ticks all of these boxes as of finer. So if we take the title of this\n\n","    publication, and\n\n","    we try to go through and pick out the Pico characteristics of the study, first we have so who is the population the key and key code, then who are we treating in this, this trial is urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. So that's the population that the study was targeting. Then in terms of the intra intervention, it's intra vesicle bacteriophages. Then for the control, it says in the title, it's placebo controlled, you'll have to read the study to find out what placebo was, then for the outcome, then its treatment. So they're really looking at the ability to treat urinary tract infections. And then if we look at the T, the type of study it is a double blind clinical trial. And I would say they could even gone further and indicated the phase of the study in this case, it would have been a phase two clinical trial.\n\n","    And when we look to design\n\n","    a study, first thing is we want to make sure that the trial is randomized, meaning that when a patient comes in, you don't know which of the treatment arms they'd be allocated to. So there's usually a whole system on how to randomize or a randomizing code. So it's not like the first 10 patients get the intervention. And then the next 10 patients get the placebo, or all of your patients starting with the first letter M get the intervention is usually a much more sophisticated and unpredictable system of deciding which patient gets which treatment. Another aspect for clinical trial design is that the study should be blinded, meaning that you should look at who actually knows who's getting what. So we could do a single blinded trial where only the patient doesn't know if what they're getting, you could do a double blinded trial where the physician, both the treating physician and the patient don't know what they're they're getting or administrating. Or depending on the design of the trial, you could also do a triple blinded saying, you know, maybe it's the person who prepares the medicines\n\n","    or\n\n","    something like that, you can either blind the study further. Then another important aspect is the control arm so you can't just you know, treat all of the patients with phages and then say okay, well this many, they their urinary tract infection got better, you have to be able to compare it to something. So in some instances, depending on the clinical indication, you would compare it to the standard of care that might be antibiotics or an answer my question We'll cream and other instances it would be a placebo. And that really depends on how the indication you're looking at is currently treated and what is ethical. And these three factors are these three things to design into the structure of a clinical trial are really important ways to reduce\n\n","    bias.\n\n","    So reduce sort of trying to structure your study in a way that will influence the final outcome. And then lastly, one other important aspect, super important aspect of a clinical trial is your expected effect. So the way that we judge if a clinical trial is a success or a failure is by looking at the primary outcome. So this is really your bottom line, what is the most important criteria that you are using or you're looking at in a clinical trial, and this is usually something when you're looking at advocacy is it's very patient centric, you know, if phages can make the bacteria go down, that's great. But if your patient still isn't feeling better, then ultimately, you wouldn't use phages in order to treat an infection. So usually, you want to have a primary outcome that is really centered around the patient. But then you can also design into the structure of a clinical trial, secondary outcomes. And this is usually where we add in aspects of microbiology, which is important for phages. Okay, an overall goal of a clinical trial is to obtain a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparing. So between, say, phages, and antibiotics or phages, and placebo, and the way that you judge that is through your primary outcome measure, and then P value of that difference. So the magical p value is really the statistical measure, then that will tell you if based off of all the the analysis you've done, if what you're looking at is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely that the outcome you are looking at is due to due to Chancellor. And my screen\n\n","    is pressing again,\n\n","    there we go.\n\n","    So another criteria, and when you're looking at a clinical trial to make sure that whatever it's saying is really sound is that studying the product safe, that there are no major biases that were introduced in the design of the study. So we saw randomization, blinding and comparatives, that the appropriate measures were taken, and super important for clinical trials are is that you used enough patience, that the intervention and the control were tested on enough people. So we'll see in a little bit that many of the clinical trials today for phage therapy involve a very few amount of patients. And when you don't have enough patients, it's difficult to know if what you're seeing is just due to chance, or if it's really something significant. And now the outcome is of a trial really affect what happens next. So if you can have a phase of a trial, say a phase one trial, and it shouldn't be safe, and then you would be allowed to progress into phase two studies. Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n","    And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem. I'm assuming if you're interested in phages, and phage therapy, then you're aware of this. But when we look back, even 3030 or 40 years ago, we would have a certain number of new antibacterial agents that were approved every year. So we're thinking, you know, back in the early 1980s, or 1980s, were up to 16 new drugs per year still being developed and approved for treating bacterial infections. Whereas now, you look down to the most recent data in this graph from 2008 to 2012. And that's maybe one or two. So that coupled with increasing costs for developing new medicines. Now they estimate that almost 400 and 60 million US dollars are required to go from, you know, when you have that bright idea to getting your authorizations, it's almost 500 million US dollars. And that is just an insane amount of money, especially when we're talking about infectious disease. You couple all of this, with the fact that time is really running out on the utility, we have antibiotics, and new alternatives are desperately needed. So if we look at how this relates a little bit to phage therapy, we've gone through the different studies. So we haven't talked before about phase zero. This is an observational study, which I would highly recommend, especially for phage based trials, because that's where you really look at your baseline demographics of a patient population. So in the incidence of urinary tract infections, for example, you would look to see which pathogens are causing the infection, look at the different strains and maybe their sensitivity to phages. Now, the phases one through four are really when you're in patience, and then this goes up in the probably the cost, but also the amount of patience, and then the different goals that you have for each of the phases. And really, the golden would you say the golden ticket is to get a successful phase three trial where you can obtain a marketing authorization. And now there's been a number shown here in these these small orange arrows of phase one safety studies that have been done with phage products. So if you look through the literature, there's quite a few of phase one trials and to date, there's been no phase one studies that have associated phage products with any type of safety concern. And then there's a few trials that now you can see in the slightly bolder orange arrows that are completed phase two trials. So this is really where they're looking for early signs of efficacy. And now that's what we're going to talk about in the next section after this short break is looking at the for phase two click clinical trials for phage therapy that have been completed today. Alright, see you in a little bit.

And we are back for the second segment of this lecture on clinical trials for phage therapy. And we've just gotten done, speaking about the first parts of why we do clinical trials and also about some of the historical events that have really shaped clinical research today. Now, I'd like to move on and show you some of the main parts of a clinical study, because clinical research is quite different than what we're used to doing in a lab per se. So one of the things is that\n\n","    you have\n\n","    to first define your research question. And the idea is you have a research question in order to address a problem or missing piece of information and afield. So, particularly for phage therapy, our problem is really dealing with antibiotic resistance, or treatment failures for infectious disease. And then with the research question, we want to be able to test a possible solution. And in our case, this is bacteria phages. So an example of a research question would be something like can bacteriophages treat urinary tract infections, infections caused by multi drug resistant bacteria. And we'll see that even this is a little bit broad, and you should start with an idea like this, and then make it even more finer. finer is one of those great acronyms we use to try to guide and structure our research question. So find R stands for F meaning feasible, I meaning interesting, and being novel, ie ethical, we saw earlier that that's very important. And our that is relevant. So you can go through after you've come up with a research question to make sure it kind of ticks all of these boxes as of finer. So if we take the title of this\n\n","    publication, and\n\n","    we try to go through and pick out the Pico characteristics of the study, first we have so who is the population the key and key code, then who are we treating in this, this trial is urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. So that's the population that the study was targeting. Then in terms of the intra intervention, it's intra vesicle bacteriophages. Then for the control, it says in the title, it's placebo controlled, you'll have to read the study to find out what placebo was, then for the outcome, then its treatment. So they're really looking at the ability to treat urinary tract infections. And then if we look at the T, the type of study it is a double blind clinical trial. And I would say they could even gone further and indicated the phase of the study in this case, it would have been a phase two clinical trial.\n\n","    And when we look to design\n\n","    a study, first thing is we want to make sure that the trial is randomized, meaning that when a patient comes in, you don't know which of the treatment arms they'd be allocated to. So there's usually a whole system on how to randomize or a randomizing code. So it's not like the first 10 patients get the intervention. And then the next 10 patients get the placebo, or all of your patients starting with the first letter M get the intervention is usually a much more sophisticated and unpredictable system of deciding which patient gets which treatment.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures.

I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy.

\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:01\n\n","    Hello everyone, this is dr. john x nalli from the University of Leicester. The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here. The liquid I'm going to transfer is an SM buffer in a falcon tube I have got my P 1000 tips. Remember these will go with the p 1000 p pets. Now, I intend to transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer into the end of chip. So I'm going to take my P 1000 compact\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:31\n\n","    and I just the controller 250.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:35\n\n","    Remember I told you that the numbers on the controller is one digit short. So the 50 is 500 microliters of volume of whatever liquid I'm going to transfer.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:59\n\n","    I'm now going to press the plunger\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:03\n\n","    to the first stop\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:10\n\n","    and push the tip of the micropipette into one of the pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:21\n\n","    While the plunger is still down,\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:27\n\n","    I'm going to insert the tip\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:31\n\n","    just touching the SM buffer remember not to go beyond the pipette tip into whatever bottle or two that you are taking the material from. Once I release the plunger I have already aspirated the platform but microliters and by pressing back the plunger to the first stop, I will not release the material into the eppendorf tube. I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957. And I've also clearly demonstrated to you how you can use the micropipette to transport liquids from one container to the other. I hope this video is useful for you and help you in your microbiology research.

This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n"]},{"id":"cee47531-83b5-47ed-8e84-1aa01040a921","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 4:33","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 4:33"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 4:33\n\n"]},{"id":"e0cb2b56-4984-43cc-9dcd-b0849253a901","type":"text","value":"Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid","properties":{"title":[["Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n"]},{"id":"d08a05a1-bd92-4e58-8bcb-1a556a4408aa","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 4:41","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 4:41"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 4:41\n\n"]},{"id":"e910c635-ed2a-4b95-875d-e0c48259f67a","type":"text","value":"into","properties":{"title":[["into"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["into\n\n"]},{"id":"da5d5d2e-48aa-428e-833e-d982dd435c1e","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 4:43","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 4:43"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 4:43\n\n"]},{"id":"b545fb54-e9d1-4c45-851b-48c4891e6054","type":"text","value":"a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame. So this is me now just opening a pipette tip on the burner. And now I'm going to pour a medium into the plate. So I've got my medium which is hot and I'm now going to pour it into the plate I need to keep the plates as close to the fire as possible and the bottle as well. Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing. So whatever has descended on the tip of the bottle need to be sterilized. Now I'm going to show you how I'm going to strip out bacteria. This is a Staphylococcus aureus culture on a blue plate. And I'm going to transfer that to a stereo plate that I've just prepared. Now this plate is all set. So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame. So this is me now just opening a pipette tip on the burner. And now I'm going to pour a medium into the plate. So I've got my medium which is hot and I'm now going to pour it into the plate I need to keep the plates as close to the fire as possible and the bottle as well. Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200. And then you can use that micropipette on the P 200. Tip. Good.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:31\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you my diluent which is going to be assemble for you can use water in this case for your crystal violet, because what we'll be diluting is 1% crystal violates and this will just help to show the graduation or the reduction of the dilution as we go down the tubes. So I'm just opening the tube now. And I am working within a class to safety cabinet. That's why I don't have a flame with me. Now I've taken my P 1000, which is such to 900 microliters capacity. Now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tip. Now I'm going to take one tip. And I'm going to transfer. As I've shown you in my initial video, you have to press the plunger to the first stop. And now I'm going to add the quote. Now 900 microliters of my di D went into the tubes, I have to add this same quantity to all the tubes 900 microliters, of diluent. And as I've said, I'm using SM buffer. But if you do not want to waste your material, you can equally use water to dilute your crystal violet. But if you're diluting your phage, you will need to use assemble for and as you can see, I'm only allowing just the end of the tip to go into the tube do not exceed that because the only sterile part of the pipette is actually the tip. So now I'm going to put the P 1000. aside and close the eppendorf tubes containing my diluent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 7:10\n\n","    All of these contain my daily but not I'm going to pick the crystal violet that I hope to dilute and is going to be 10 for dilution, because each tube is daily diluted a tenfold to the next two.

So I'm now open my crystal violet. And I'm going to add that to the first tube which is the minus one tube. I'm going to resuspend that couple of time. And I'm going to throw away that pipette tip.

Now I'm going to go in to the minus two tube and take 100 microliters in there and that will be transferred into minus three tube. Now discard it again and pay the fresh tip and not open the minus three and that is how I'm going to do until the crystal violet is diluted tenfold across the tubes. So all you're doing is just gradually diluting your initial stock sample reducing the numbers with the amount by a tenfold Just remember to keep changing the tip as you dilute.\n\n","    Janet Nale 9:58\n\n","    That is the minor six We are graduating to minus seven MCs.

But for this case, this is unnecessary. So I'm just showing you the graduation of the color of the crystal violet within the tube. And as you can see, by the time we get to minus eight, it is basically\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 10:42\n\n","    reduced\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:44\n\n","    drastically to a clear liquid.

So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent.

And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200. And then you can use that micropipette on the P 200. Tip. Good.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:31\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you my diluent which is going to be assemble for you can use water in this case for your crystal violet, because what we'll be diluting is 1% crystal violates and this will just help to show the graduation or the reduction of the dilution as we go down the tubes.

So if you haven't seen my previous video on how I use crystal violet, diluting it to decreasing concentration, please, I will really recommend that you have a look at that video because that will greatly help in the understanding of the serial dilution that we are going to conduct now on the phage. So I'm going to dilute this page because I need to enumerate the number of phage, or the concentration of phage within this feature lysate that I have got. So I have got a universal truth here containing some phage. So now I'm going to I have already added SM buffer into the tube. And because I'm going to do my dilution in one meal that is 1000 microliters, I have added 900 microliters of the SM buffer into each of the tubes shown in the video. So I've labeled that minus one to minus eight. And I've picked my P 1000 micropipette. And I've set it to 100 microliters. And now I'm going to use my P 200. Tips, which will fit my P 100. micropipette. I'm going to take one of each and transfer 100 microliters. So if you refer back to my video, the crystal violet, I have to use the same method to dilute the crystal violet. And this is a 10 fold serial dilution. So 100 microliters of the phage lysate is going to be transferred to my first tube containing my 900 microliters of the diamond which is SM buffer and I'm mixing it by pipetting up and down just a couple of times using the plunger. I'm going to throw that tip away. And I'm going to take a fresh tip you have to change the tip because you're moving for from a higher concentration to a lower concentration or in your diner. And so I've just aspirated 100 microliters of the minus one diluted sample, and I've added it to the minus two tube, mix it throw away the tape, I'm not taking a fresh tip, and going in to the minus two tube aspirating 100 microliters and then adding that to the minus three tube. And I'm just mixed it might be putting up and down, threw away that pipette tip and then taking the minus three removing hundred microliters into minus four. So this is just diluting my phage from a very high concentration to low concentration in a systematic way using 10 fold dilution methods. And it is reducing my phage to a certain amount that I will be able to count. Now I'm adding from the minus five to minus six. throwing away the pet got fresh pet back to minus six. Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight. So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections.

So I've labeled that minus one to minus eight. And I've picked my P 1000 micropipette. And I've set it to 100 microliters. And now I'm going to use my P 200. Tips, which will fit my P 100. micropipette. I'm going to take one of each and transfer 100 microliters. So if you refer back to my video, the crystal violet, I have to use the same method to dilute the crystal violet. And this is a 10 fold serial dilution. So 100 microliters of the phage lysate is going to be transferred to my first tube containing my 900 microliters of the diamond which is SM buffer and I'm mixing it by pipetting up and down just a couple of times using the plunger. I'm going to throw that tip away. And I'm going to take a fresh tip you have to change the tip because you're moving for from a higher concentration to a lower concentration or in your diner. And so I've just aspirated 100 microliters of the minus one diluted sample, and I've added it to the minus two tube, mix it throw away the tape, I'm not taking a fresh tip, and going in to the minus two tube aspirating 100 microliters and then adding that to the minus three tube. And I'm just mixed it might be putting up and down, threw away that pipette tip and then taking the minus three removing hundred microliters into minus four. So this is just diluting my phage from a very high concentration to low concentration in a systematic way using 10 fold dilution methods. And it is reducing my phage to a certain amount that I will be able to count. Now I'm adding from the minus five to minus six. throwing away the pet got fresh pet back to minus six. Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight.

In this video, we are going to apply our knowledge on serial dilution to be able to enumerate a phage.

And today part as part of your lab video series, which you've largely heard from Dr. Janet nalli. Today, I'll be talking to you about sterilizing media. So for many of you, this is probably something that you're quite used to doing. Maybe if you're new edit, there's always some tix tips and tricks to pick up on. So I will go over some of the basic things about how to prepare media, how to mix it well before sterilizing, then how to autoclave it, as well as some common practices for storage. And then very importantly, to always look for contaminations before starting your experiments. So first of all, we talked about preparing media. This is an example of how to make lb growth media. So this is Luria bertani. broth says very commonly used, especially for things like E. coli. So here you've got your recipe, with the different chemicals that you need, shown down here with the different pictures, and then the amount that you need for making a specific volume. So either one leader, as shown here, or sometimes we'll add in if we have a common volume to already pre do the calculation, as shown here for eight liters. So lb broth liquid is usually used to drum in order to make overnight cultures have your bacteria, or with phages, sometimes to do turbidity reduction assays. So you've got your recipe, your chemicals, make sure you've got very clean glassware, as well as a scale to weigh the different chemicals. Now, if we wanted to make another type of media we can build off of this recipe. And the example here I'm showing is how to make lb agar plates. So the petri dishes that you would use in a lot of the types of experiments we would be doing. And so here you use lb IR, to plate bacteria to do viable bacterial enumeration, as well as doing phage specific experiments such as phage, titration, and spot assays. So here, the recipe is the same as before, except for the addition of 15 grams per liter of agere. And now, there's another common media that we use in phage research that I haven't seen in many other experiments. This is lb soft agere or lb sloppy agere. So if you hear soft or sloppy agere, this refers to a type of agbar, that is prepared almost the same well, exactly the same way, except for you add a lower amount of agere into the media, so it's not quite as solid. And we use this when we're trying to mix the phage and bacteria and see their interaction. So we use these for either the spot essays, or for doing phage titrations and double layers. And so as you can see here, instead of 15 grams per liter. And this recipe in our lab, we add four grams per liter for 0.4%. In the final bottle that you'll be using some labs use a slightly higher percentage before I was using 0.7%. So it's just worth looking at see the recipe that you should be following for your experiments. And now here, you can see that when you first start off with, you've got your scale and then whatever you're using to weigh the different chemicals. And you have to make sure that you actually break your scale on zero before weighing. So this is just for the first chemical.\n\n","    And then you add it. So here we've got 10 grams of tryptone. Add that to your bottle, move on to yeast extract, then NaCl and then finally agere. And what's important is that you use one of these recipients and don't add your chemicals directly into the bottle in case that you add too much. And it's very difficult to remove from a mixed solution like that. So weigh them all individually, put them into your bottles. And then when you're ready, it's time to mix. So the first thing is to add an amount of milli q water to a total to the total volume that you're looking for. For example, here you have got one liter so this could be milli q or sterilized double distilled water, something that's quite clean that you'll be using in your final preparation. And then next you have to stir or shake to mixed well. And in order to do that, here you can see the photo that when you prepare the media and you let it sit for some time, it can really sediment on the bottom like this. So you've got really aqueous phase and then all of the agora nutrients kind of collect on the bottom. And what we do to solve that problem is we would add a magnetic stir so you can just drop a little magnetic stir in there, and then put that onto a plate. Here I've got a little video showing how that mixes the media really well. And then once you're done with that, you can see that it really makes everything quite turbid and homogeneous. And if you don't have magnetic stirs, or a stirring plate, that's okay, just make sure bottles closed really well give it a good shake, a lot of times, I'll hit it against my hip, or something to make sure that it really shakes well. And what you're trying to do here is to avoid having like little clumps, or things like that of the media, within the solution itself. Because if you have clumps, when you go to autoclave it, it won't reach or penetrate very deeply in there, to try to mix it as much as you can to remove the clumps. Now, when you're autoclaving, the media, you put it into the autoclave, and what's very important is to label your bottles. So normally, what I'll do is I'll put whatever it is that I've been making, whatever the date is, and my initials. And why it's important for whatever it's, whatever it is, is normally you know, you're putting it into the autoclave, it doesn't mean you're always the person to get it out. So it's important and a good idea to label what it is that you're autoclaving. Now, the second other thing to keep in mind is that you should be using autoclave tape. So this is this nice tape that is white before you put it into the autoclave. And after a certain amount of time, ahead of temperature and pressure, the tape will change color. And I'll show you an example of that in a minute. So another thing is to make sure that you keep the lid open slightly. This is just because when it's getting hot, you need that pressure to be able to remove or else you'll explode your bottle, this would not be very good. So I just tend to open it slightly so that you know if there's steam, it could get out. And then lastly, you would put your your media that you've prepared into the autoclave. And then each autoclave is a little bit different. So this way, you really have to make sure make sure you ask whoever is there who has used the machine before how to use it correctly and safely. Now here you can see the example of when you've got not autoclave versus autoclaved. So this is the way that we know that the media has been properly sterilized. And then after once the autoclave is over, we keep in mind that the bottles and the liquids will be extremely hot. So make sure that you've got gloves or some type of protective wear in order to remove the bottles or just wait for a certain amount of time until it's cooled down a little bit. So media without agbar could then just be taken out and left at room temperature. But if you're making something such as LBI Gar or soft or sloppy, either, you don't want to put that oops, and that's a typo that should not be five that should be 50 to 60 degrees Celsius is gonna make a very big difference. So please take note of that. So if you're making anything with argon, you should let it equilibrate at a temperature of 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. Now this is usually done in either an incubator set at that temperature or in a water bath. And this is because when it comes out of the autoclave, it's super, super hot. And you need to let the temperature cool down to a working temperature where the Aguilar is still in its liquid phase, but that won't burn through your plates or your tubes or kill your bacteria. So another thing to keep in mind is make sure you know we opened it slightly before we put it into the autoclave. Now if this is the right time to make sure that you close the bottles very tightly afterwards\n\n","    to there as a reminder, again to check your labor your lines for the autoclave. And, yes, last reminder, eco delivery at the temperature desired before using and very, very important. Before you would use any of the media you've made containing anger, you know, we shake shook it really well before we put it into the autoclave, but when you take it out, look at it. Again, you'll probably have this sort of sedimentation onto the bottom. So when you take anything with ag or before making plates or doing with anything with the soft dagger, make sure you give it a good shake. Sometimes you'll see the Eiger sort of swirl around and then redistribute in the bottle. Because what happens is if you don't do that, and you take maybe say from this top layer, it doesn't contain as much anger from the bottom and you'll have inconsistent percentages a bag or or even the anger won't solidify. So give it a good shake before using it. Like that. All right, so just a quick word about storing media. The first thing you should ask yourself is does it have Aguilar in it or not? So if not like the lb broth we talked about earlier you Just take it out and leave it at room temperature. Now, if it does contain IR, if you want to use it right away, then you should put it into this incubator or water bath at 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. And this way, it'll cool it down to a working temperature. And if you want to keep it for using later, you can leave it at room temperature at which point it will solidify. But then keep in mind, you have to have some way to remelt it if you want to use it in the future. So maybe a microwave or something, I don't really like to do this, it's kind of a pain. But if that's the way you do things in the lab or the way you have to because you make in a different location, that's okay, just keep in mind, you're going to need to have some way to melt it again, before you could use it in any experiments. And another quick word about using a water bath is that Be careful if you leave something in a water bath too long because contaminations can occur. I've seen this a lot because the water itself can get quite dirty. And then if there's a little drop that gets in, it can infect or contaminate your media. So that brings us on to the last topic, which is contaminations. So what you can see here is that a mold somehow got into the plate, and now has contaminated this this was previously used for bacterial culture. Now this can happen on plates, for example that you've just stored. So say you poured our plates, and you leave them on your bench to cool down and use them the next day. If there's any type of small spores in the air. Or if you weren't using a Bunsen burner or something like that, it's possible that your plates could get a mold like growth on them. And really, what's important is always just to look and check your material before you're using it. So look for mold, or if you're looking at the the liquid media itself, pick up the bottle and swirl it around. And if you see then afterwards, if there's a sort of spiral or like a little hurricane of something inside your media, it's probably because it's contaminated. And you definitely shouldn't use it for your experiments. So again, be careful if you're using a water bath, try not to use a water bath for increased periods of time, like I'll use it for the experiment I'm doing and then I shut it off. So my tubes are in the water only for a few hours. But if you're using it to store your your media really have to make sure that the water itself as well as clean, or you're running an increased risk of contamination. And lastly, if you're pouring our plates, try to store them at four degrees after they've solidified. And until you're ready to use them. And this will also decrease your risk of contamination. So in conclusion, always, always ask about local procedures that they're in place for making media. This can be different in different labs, the best thing to do is follow the protocol and the lab where you're at. Always ask questions and be careful when you're using an autoclave. And then secondly, that's it, use your autoclave, be safe, most important. And then make sure that you will shake your media before you pour plates or doing any type of experiments to really mix that Eiger really well. And then lastly, check for contaminations. So I hope that was helpful. And just a quick reminder for some on how to use and sterilize media properly. Make sure that you're starting off your experiments with something sterile, and that the results you obtain are what you want to see and not because you're married, your media wasn't sterilized property. So thank you and good luck with your experiments.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 13:41\n\n","    Bye\n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["7df93a5a-d397-47bd-9945-c68b72623f9a"],"content":[{"id":"7df93a5a-d397-47bd-9945-c68b72623f9a","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"05fa5cea-41a6-467c-9ccc-deec0984ffd8","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n","    Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen at the bogus University Hospital here in Zurich, Switzerland. And today part as part of your lab video series, which you've largely heard from Dr. Janet nalli. Today, I'll be talking to you about sterilizing media. So for many of you, this is probably something that you're quite used to doing. Maybe if you're new edit, there's always some tix tips and tricks to pick up on. So I will go over some of the basic things about how to prepare media, how to mix it well before sterilizing, then how to autoclave it, as well as some common practices for storage. And then very importantly, to always look for contaminations before starting your experiments. So first of all, we talked about preparing media. This is an example of how to make lb growth media. So this is Luria bertani. broth says very commonly used, especially for things like E. coli. So here you've got your recipe, with the different chemicals that you need, shown down here with the different pictures, and then the amount that you need for making a specific volume. So either one leader, as shown here, or sometimes we'll add in if we have a common volume to already pre do the calculation, as shown here for eight liters. So lb broth liquid is usually used to drum in order to make overnight cultures have your bacteria, or with phages, sometimes to do turbidity reduction assays. So you've got your recipe, your chemicals, make sure you've got very clean glassware, as well as a scale to weigh the different chemicals. Now, if we wanted to make another type of media we can build off of this recipe. And the example here I'm showing is how to make lb agar plates. So the petri dishes that you would use in a lot of the types of experiments we would be doing. And so here you use lb IR, to plate bacteria to do viable bacterial enumeration, as well as doing phage specific experiments such as phage, titration, and spot assays. So here, the recipe is the same as before, except for the addition of 15 grams per liter of agere. And now, there's another common media that we use in phage research that I haven't seen in many other experiments. This is lb soft agere or lb sloppy agere. So if you hear soft or sloppy agere, this refers to a type of agbar, that is prepared almost the same well, exactly the same way, except for you add a lower amount of agere into the media, so it's not quite as solid. And we use this when we're trying to mix the phage and bacteria and see their interaction. So we use these for either the spot essays, or for doing phage titrations and double layers. And so as you can see here, instead of 15 grams per liter. And this recipe in our lab, we add four grams per liter for 0.4%. In the final bottle that you'll be using some labs use a slightly higher percentage before I was using 0.7%. So it's just worth looking at see the recipe that you should be following for your experiments. And now here, you can see that when you first start off with, you've got your scale and then whatever you're using to weigh the different chemicals. And you have to make sure that you actually break your scale on zero before weighing. So this is just for the first chemical.\n\n","    And then you add it. So here we've got 10 grams of tryptone. Add that to your bottle, move on to yeast extract, then NaCl and then finally agere. And what's important is that you use one of these recipients and don't add your chemicals directly into the bottle in case that you add too much. And it's very difficult to remove from a mixed solution like that. So weigh them all individually, put them into your bottles. And then when you're ready, it's time to mix. So the first thing is to add an amount of milli q water to a total to the total volume that you're looking for. For example, here you have got one liter so this could be milli q or sterilized double distilled water, something that's quite clean that you'll be using in your final preparation. And then next you have to stir or shake to mixed well. And in order to do that, here you can see the photo that when you prepare the media and you let it sit for some time, it can really sediment on the bottom like this. So you've got really aqueous phase and then all of the agora nutrients kind of collect on the bottom. And what we do to solve that problem is we would add a magnetic stir so you can just drop a little magnetic stir in there, and then put that onto a plate. Here I've got a little video showing how that mixes the media really well. And then once you're done with that, you can see that it really makes everything quite turbid and homogeneous. And if you don't have magnetic stirs, or a stirring plate, that's okay, just make sure bottles closed really well give it a good shake, a lot of times, I'll hit it against my hip, or something to make sure that it really shakes well. And what you're trying to do here is to avoid having like little clumps, or things like that of the media, within the solution itself. Because if you have clumps, when you go to autoclave it, it won't reach or penetrate very deeply in there, to try to mix it as much as you can to remove the clumps. Now, when you're autoclaving, the media, you put it into the autoclave, and what's very important is to label your bottles. So normally, what I'll do is I'll put whatever it is that I've been making, whatever the date is, and my initials. And why it's important for whatever it's, whatever it is, is normally you know, you're putting it into the autoclave, it doesn't mean you're always the person to get it out. So it's important and a good idea to label what it is that you're autoclaving. Now, the second other thing to keep in mind is that you should be using autoclave tape. So this is this nice tape that is white before you put it into the autoclave. And after a certain amount of time, ahead of temperature and pressure, the tape will change color. And I'll show you an example of that in a minute. So another thing is to make sure that you keep the lid open slightly. This is just because when it's getting hot, you need that pressure to be able to remove or else you'll explode your bottle, this would not be very good. So I just tend to open it slightly so that you know if there's steam, it could get out. And then lastly, you would put your your media that you've prepared into the autoclave. And then each autoclave is a little bit different. So this way, you really have to make sure make sure you ask whoever is there who has used the machine before how to use it correctly and safely. Now here you can see the example of when you've got not autoclave versus autoclaved. So this is the way that we know that the media has been properly sterilized. And then after once the autoclave is over, we keep in mind that the bottles and the liquids will be extremely hot. So make sure that you've got gloves or some type of protective wear in order to remove the bottles or just wait for a certain amount of time until it's cooled down a little bit. So media without agbar could then just be taken out and left at room temperature. But if you're making something such as LBI Gar or soft or sloppy, either, you don't want to put that oops, and that's a typo that should not be five that should be 50 to 60 degrees Celsius is gonna make a very big difference. So please take note of that. So if you're making anything with argon, you should let it equilibrate at a temperature of 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. Now this is usually done in either an incubator set at that temperature or in a water bath. And this is because when it comes out of the autoclave, it's super, super hot. And you need to let the temperature cool down to a working temperature where the Aguilar is still in its liquid phase, but that won't burn through your plates or your tubes or kill your bacteria. So another thing to keep in mind is make sure you know we opened it slightly before we put it into the autoclave. Now if this is the right time to make sure that you close the bottles very tightly afterwards\n\n","    to there as a reminder, again to check your labor your lines for the autoclave. And, yes, last reminder, eco delivery at the temperature desired before using and very, very important. Before you would use any of the media you've made containing anger, you know, we shake shook it really well before we put it into the autoclave, but when you take it out, look at it. Again, you'll probably have this sort of sedimentation onto the bottom. So when you take anything with ag or before making plates or doing with anything with the soft dagger, make sure you give it a good shake. Sometimes you'll see the Eiger sort of swirl around and then redistribute in the bottle. Because what happens is if you don't do that, and you take maybe say from this top layer, it doesn't contain as much anger from the bottom and you'll have inconsistent percentages a bag or or even the anger won't solidify.

So media without agbar could then just be taken out and left at room temperature. But if you're making something such as LBI Gar or soft or sloppy, either, you don't want to put that oops, and that's a typo that should not be five that should be 50 to 60 degrees Celsius is gonna make a very big difference. So please take note of that. So if you're making anything with argon, you should let it equilibrate at a temperature of 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. Now this is usually done in either an incubator set at that temperature or in a water bath. And this is because when it comes out of the autoclave, it's super, super hot. And you need to let the temperature cool down to a working temperature where the Aguilar is still in its liquid phase, but that won't burn through your plates or your tubes or kill your bacteria. So another thing to keep in mind is make sure you know we opened it slightly before we put it into the autoclave. Now if this is the right time to make sure that you close the bottles very tightly afterwards","properties":{"title":[["And then you add it. So here we've got 10 grams of tryptone. Add that to your bottle, move on to yeast extract, then NaCl and then finally agere. And what's important is that you use one of these recipients and don't add your chemicals directly into the bottle in case that you add too much. And it's very difficult to remove from a mixed solution like that. So weigh them all individually, put them into your bottles. And then when you're ready, it's time to mix. So the first thing is to add an amount of milli q water to a total to the total volume that you're looking for. For example, here you have got one liter so this could be milli q or sterilized double distilled water, something that's quite clean that you'll be using in your final preparation. And then next you have to stir or shake to mixed well. And in order to do that, here you can see the photo that when you prepare the media and you let it sit for some time, it can really sediment on the bottom like this. So you've got really aqueous phase and then all of the agora nutrients kind of collect on the bottom. And what we do to solve that problem is we would add a magnetic stir so you can just drop a little magnetic stir in there, and then put that onto a plate. Here I've got a little video showing how that mixes the media really well. And then once you're done with that, you can see that it really makes everything quite turbid and homogeneous. And if you don't have magnetic stirs, or a stirring plate, that's okay, just make sure bottles closed really well give it a good shake, a lot of times, I'll hit it against my hip, or something to make sure that it really shakes well. And what you're trying to do here is to avoid having like little clumps, or things like that of the media, within the solution itself. Because if you have clumps, when you go to autoclave it, it won't reach or penetrate very deeply in there, to try to mix it as much as you can to remove the clumps. Now, when you're autoclaving, the media, you put it into the autoclave, and what's very important is to label your bottles. So normally, what I'll do is I'll put whatever it is that I've been making, whatever the date is, and my initials. And why it's important for whatever it's, whatever it is, is normally you know, you're putting it into the autoclave, it doesn't mean you're always the person to get it out. So it's important and a good idea to label what it is that you're autoclaving. Now, the second other thing to keep in mind is that you should be using autoclave tape. So this is this nice tape that is white before you put it into the autoclave. And after a certain amount of time, ahead of temperature and pressure, the tape will change color. And I'll show you an example of that in a minute. So another thing is to make sure that you keep the lid open slightly. This is just because when it's getting hot, you need that pressure to be able to remove or else you'll explode your bottle, this would not be very good. So I just tend to open it slightly so that you know if there's steam, it could get out. And then lastly, you would put your your media that you've prepared into the autoclave. And then each autoclave is a little bit different. So this way, you really have to make sure make sure you ask whoever is there who has used the machine before how to use it correctly and safely. Now here you can see the example of when you've got not autoclave versus autoclaved. So this is the way that we know that the media has been properly sterilized. And then after once the autoclave is over, we keep in mind that the bottles and the liquids will be extremely hot.

And, yes, last reminder, eco delivery at the temperature desired before using and very, very important. Before you would use any of the media you've made containing anger, you know, we shake shook it really well before we put it into the autoclave, but when you take it out, look at it. Again, you'll probably have this sort of sedimentation onto the bottom. So when you take anything with ag or before making plates or doing with anything with the soft dagger, make sure you give it a good shake. Sometimes you'll see the Eiger sort of swirl around and then redistribute in the bottle. Because what happens is if you don't do that, and you take maybe say from this top layer, it doesn't contain as much anger from the bottom and you'll have inconsistent percentages a bag or or even the anger won't solidify. So give it a good shake before using it. Like that. All right, so just a quick word about storing media. The first thing you should ask yourself is does it have Aguilar in it or not? So if not like the lb broth we talked about earlier you Just take it out and leave it at room temperature. Now, if it does contain IR, if you want to use it right away, then you should put it into this incubator or water bath at 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. And this way, it'll cool it down to a working temperature. And if you want to keep it for using later, you can leave it at room temperature at which point it will solidify. But then keep in mind, you have to have some way to remelt it if you want to use it in the future. So maybe a microwave or something, I don't really like to do this, it's kind of a pain. But if that's the way you do things in the lab or the way you have to because you make in a different location, that's okay, just keep in mind, you're going to need to have some way to melt it again, before you could use it in any experiments. And another quick word about using a water bath is that Be careful if you leave something in a water bath too long because contaminations can occur. I've seen this a lot because the water itself can get quite dirty. And then if there's a little drop that gets in, it can infect or contaminate your media. So that brings us on to the last topic, which is contaminations. So what you can see here is that a mold somehow got into the plate, and now has contaminated this this was previously used for bacterial culture. Now this can happen on plates, for example that you've just stored. So say you poured our plates, and you leave them on your bench to cool down and use them the next day. If there's any type of small spores in the air. Or if you weren't using a Bunsen burner or something like that, it's possible that your plates could get a mold like growth on them. And really, what's important is always just to look and check your material before you're using it. So look for mold, or if you're looking at the the liquid media itself, pick up the bottle and swirl it around. And if you see then afterwards, if there's a sort of spiral or like a little hurricane of something inside your media, it's probably because it's contaminated. And you definitely shouldn't use it for your experiments. So again, be careful if you're using a water bath, try not to use a water bath for increased periods of time, like I'll use it for the experiment I'm doing and then I shut it off. So my tubes are in the water only for a few hours. But if you're using it to store your your media really have to make sure that the water itself as well as clean, or you're running an increased risk of contamination. And lastly, if you're pouring our plates, try to store them at four degrees after they've solidified. And until you're ready to use them. And this will also decrease your risk of contamination. So in conclusion, always, always ask about local procedures that they're in place for making media. This can be different in different labs, the best thing to do is follow the protocol and the lab where you're at. Always ask questions and be careful when you're using an autoclave. And then secondly, that's it, use your autoclave, be safe, most important. And then make sure that you will shake your media before you pour plates or doing any type of experiments to really mix that Eiger really well. And then lastly, check for contaminations. So I hope that was helpful. And just a quick reminder for some on how to use and sterilize media properly. Make sure that you're starting off your experiments with something sterile, and that the results you obtain are what you want to see and not because you're married, your media wasn't sterilized property.

0:00\n\n","    Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory. In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.\n\n","    So the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.\n\n","    We have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.\n\n","    phages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.\n\n","    Here's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.\n\n","    We accomplish this mission in two general programs. The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.\n\n","    So these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.\n\n","    From their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.\n\n","    Our first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process. And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019. And we actually had participants from six different countries in West Africa that was hosted in Ghana. And then most recently, in January 2020. We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.\n\n","    Let me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform. We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops. In the most recent East Africa workshop. They came from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, they represented 14 different institutions. And they came from all different levels within their careers, graduate students, technicians, research assistants, lecturers, professors, professors and government scientists. And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.\n\n","    funders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible. So we're very grateful for this community involvement.\n\n","    At this workshop, we had our three original instructors, Professor Martha cloaky, from the University of Leicester, in the UK, and Dr. Janet nali. Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching. This time we had Slav, mich new ski from the University of Warwick in the UK.\n\n","    And the goals of each workshop are not only to learn phage biology and experimental techniques, but also this is really important to develop a network of phage researchers starting in the given region, East Africa or say Southeast Asia, and then helping to connect them to other researchers throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US are America and\n\n","    the topics covered include phage, ecology, molecular biology, various models for studying how phages interact with their bacteria phage applications in agriculture, including both animals and crops, phage therapy, compassionate use cases as well as clinical trials. And then each of the instructors talks about their current area of phage research to give some very practical examples of how phages might be applied. We also try to help the participants of the workshop prepare to get funding for their phage product projects, and also how to engage with the public that might be with a few\n\n","    consumers of their phage product, the regulatory authorities, whoever it may be,\n\n","    to get the support, they'll need to get phages utilized in their country. And then we're constantly compiling collection of key scientific publications. And we discussed that many of those during the workshops.\n\n","    So just to give you an idea, at the end of the first two week workshop, as I said, which was hosted in Uganda in 2017, we were able to successfully isolate some phages, we being the participants of the workshop with support from the instructors. And so here are some transmission electron microscope images, microscopic images of some of the phages that were isolated. We've named these all up for Uganda phage, to a through five B. These were originally isolated from a sewage plant outside Kampala, Uganda, pure originally purified in Uganda and then further characterized back in the UK. And all of these have been made available to the participants of the workshop. So it's exciting to see that within just two weeks, phages can begin to be isolated by these workshop participants.\n\n","    I mentioned that the network develop and the development and the relationships is a really important part of this. And I'm highlighting this spend a few hours together in a sewage plant, and it's a very bonding experience. You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.\n\n","    So let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.\n\n","    Starting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.\n\n","    Then after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And\n\n","    then, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants. So they were either starting new projects or significantly modifying projects that they'd previously initiated, because they'd learned some key things from attending our workshop. There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.\n\n","    Even more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.\n\n","    And at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first\n\n","    from all of the\n\n","    workshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's\n\n","    Just within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.\n\n","    So now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.\n\n","    Our intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries. And it's akin to this saying from Lao Tzu and Martha cookie first made this slide. If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. And so as Martha rewarded this, if you give a woman or man a phage, you may treat one infection. Teach a woman or man how to isolate phages and you may treat multiple infections caused by many different pathogens. And that's our goal and hope here. Thanks much.\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n","  &lt;a  rel=prefetch href=\"/lectures\" class=\"_button __cta __width-full _margin-top-2 _margin-bottom-none-i\"&gt;Explore our phage lectures&lt;/a&gt;\n\n"],"children":["355baba6-8a4a-4f83-99ad-f0daccbb63e8","d5994f1d-693d-44c5-bc6b-ae38859d28ff","04ab2ccd-b475-4528-8b74-34fd11acb1a8","e15810e1-b8af-42f8-98a1-b9f2b019d45e","d8168f97-7df0-41b9-92a9-f2720da84a05","3120190e-9616-442b-b80c-4bc40e1f6aae","fd9d7b53-b8c6-481e-8a84-b0e206168abd","9c79e99c-f3b6-4848-bf6e-62c93f3304af"],"content":[{"id":"355baba6-8a4a-4f83-99ad-f0daccbb63e8","type":"text","parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"d5994f1d-693d-44c5-bc6b-ae38859d28ff","type":"text","value":"Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!","properties":{"title":[["Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!"]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!\n\n"]},{"id":"04ab2ccd-b475-4528-8b74-34fd11acb1a8","type":"text","parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"e15810e1-b8af-42f8-98a1-b9f2b019d45e","type":"text","value":"Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions.","properties":{"title":[["Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions."]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions.\n\n"]},{"id":"d8168f97-7df0-41b9-92a9-f2720da84a05","type":"text","parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"3120190e-9616-442b-b80c-4bc40e1f6aae","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","              Tobi Nagel 0:00\n\n","              Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory.

You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.\n\n","              So let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.\n\n","              Starting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.\n\n","              Then after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And\n\n","              then, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants. So they were either starting new projects or significantly modifying projects that they'd previously initiated, because they'd learned some key things from attending our workshop. There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.\n\n","              Even more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.\n\n","              And at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first\n\n","              from all of the\n\n","              workshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's\n\n","              Just within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.\n\n","              So now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.\n\n","              Our intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries. And it's akin to this saying from Lao Tzu and Martha cookie first made this slide. If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. And so as Martha rewarded this, if you give a woman or man a phage, you may treat one infection. Teach a woman or man how to isolate phages and you may treat multiple infections caused by many different pathogens. And that's our goal and hope here. Thanks much.\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["5374a5ec-812f-4849-b706-f704952fc3e6","72016cbd-756f-40f0-8b14-9c8cb2c10659","fd38468d-1e7c-4dc6-baaf-19d02af0f48e","e96fec0f-a3f5-4d5f-b564-bc5d489eb870","66bf3ba8-1894-4102-971c-627e19bd4d5c","d70f8ccd-efc6-4938-b9f8-f7fe764b84d6","1bc7dc1d-fed7-4ae5-a3de-9db555b1b532","3c45e6f8-13a4-4970-9b2f-e97dd6409258","03685f47-c465-4de6-89fa-8ef63d0e9620","41e10795-363f-4635-bd19-b6e7c37b4d5f","bed4f10a-3858-42b4-8355-462e449f6842","85d1fa8a-eeac-44cc-a4ae-578348c091fe","6fbdb087-a215-4d40-bda8-4a6d2f01b430","7b3dec5e-eb5f-432c-83ee-e0166ac42a33","4625f180-6d42-4904-8328-58a1fa883c1f","d786c9d7-4003-43aa-a1e3-d50670c41fba","982ed912-c796-4190-9ef5-303319472d35","bf0ed75a-b380-48cd-981d-87c13e8c2f12","1c2e30c2-b83c-4d59-9746-b772e0650e28","409683ff-8715-408c-a6bf-2981b336a795","5aa06999-fbb7-4fe6-8d47-ca29f37eb0b1","b8da7dad-9270-4b33-97b4-1f50f3fe977b","23cc5e3a-049a-46ac-be88-f558d6ec0e92","3cf342a9-ff77-41f1-8353-0dcdb050d5eb","dfef9cc2-f73c-48bf-b0bf-b9711901d19d","1bf59dc5-2e65-4cd1-a8f0-734b95f2d4a0","dc38e83c-c885-43dd-a756-50fd9d2e9c06","654647f7-2a30-4690-927d-8e5927fc33dc","b1c35071-dfa0-4646-8ded-961da0026d84","2509a1d6-3ce8-4f6e-9206-9e02d3a21726"],"content":[{"id":"5374a5ec-812f-4849-b706-f704952fc3e6","type":"text","value":"Tobi Nagel 0:00","properties":{"title":[["Tobi Nagel 0:00"]]},"parent_id":"3120190e-9616-442b-b80c-4bc40e1f6aae","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Tobi Nagel 0:00\n\n"]},{"id":"72016cbd-756f-40f0-8b14-9c8cb2c10659","type":"text","value":"Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory.

auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:02\n\n","    Hi there. Today I thought we'd talk about phage therapy. So I have a few sort of lectures will break them up into several pieces about phage therapy, and we'll talk about compassionate use cases, mostly Shauna, in another series of lectures is going to talk to you about clinical trials. I'm going to talk about more than one off cases. But we'll talk about some of the principles of face therapy before that, and we'll get to that in just a minute. So just to get you guys excited for it, I thought I'd introduce the case first. And this was the first case that we treated Yale, this was back in 2016. And it was one of the more sort of recent big cases that sort of, well, it's sort of started the momentum phage therapy, sort of helped bring it where it is, a so this case is the case of a prosthetic vascular graft infection with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And so this case started with an 80 year old male that had an aortic aneurysm. And what that is, is this vessel coming out of the heart that walls will slightly weakened, and it started bleeding out. And if this ruptures to\n\n","    catastrophic\n\n","    event, and certainly fatal, and so when there's sign of an aneurism like this, especially in the aorta, it needs to be repaired. And so what happened was this individual went under, and went to surgery and had an aortic arch replacement. And so what they did is they cut off a chunk of the aorta, and they replaced it with a piece of paper on and so they grafted this onto the aorta back in 2012. And so, you know, shortly after, after infection, and hit a, you know, a really bad infection post surgery, which spread to the sternum and actually eventually had to go in and remove the sternum and a lot of bone.\n\n","    As a result,\n\n","    in 2013, he came back to hospital with bacteremia, especially with monus. And then he also had draining fistula. So what that was, is there was basically a whole draining from his chest. He also had environment that was draining process and Pseudomonas. And its origin was a face of getting worse. When this happened, they manage this infection with iv subterra, Diem, and Cipro and then they also provided more the chest wall. And then they sent them home. But he was admitted three additional times in 2013, with, you know, increased drainage from the fistula, and bacteremia again, so he would be on antibiotics, he'd stopped taking them after the course was done. And then five days later, he would be back screaming. So for those of you that may not know what a meme is, it's when there's bacteria in the blood. So it's a pretty serious infection. Okay, so in October 2014, he had a imaging done, and it showed an increase of fluid at the base of the aorta, which is how they identified the infection site and the cultures that they pulled from the drainage or intermediate resistant to Cipro. And so they started IPsec. Again, and just as before, when he would stop taking sagacity he had fever and vektory me again. So this went on for another year. So he's been on antibiotics for, geez, two years now. And then by late 2015, actually, some blood started coming out of this fistula. And it was concerning because people thought that maybe the infection had eroded into the base of the aorta, and it was leaking a little bit. And if that happens, you know, that's the equivalent of an aneurysm rupturing. So this is a problem because, due to his advanced age, they couldn't go in and surgically remove the graft and replace it with a different\n\n","    one.\n\n","    And so, because of risk of mortality, so we were looking for alternative ways of which we might treat this case. This is our first case. We'll talk more about it later. Before we get there, I thought we'd talk about some of these a couple of historic cases. So these are from courtesy of a friend of mine from country of Georgia, who told me about these cases. And they were, these four cases happened in Georgia. And the first one is a radiation burn on those infected with Staph aureus. So this individual had a pretty severe radiation Bernice can see on a zero here, which failed to resolve after a month of hospitalization. The then treated him they started treating them with bacteria phages, with a product called h biodome, which is like a bandage that's, that contains pages for staff equal, like klebsiella, and Pseudomonas. So they basically placed this bandage on his burn daily. And then by day seven, basically, that was the the wound looked like it was improving, as you can see in the photos here, and it was less drainage of us. And when they did cultures of the wound, they saw that they were negative. So it looks like phages, in combination with antibiotics might have helped resolve\n\n","    that wound.\n\n","    And the next one is a severe wound as you can see, those infected by Pseudomonas, and this was a 46 year old male with severe trauma to the left forum. He had this injury, fishing accident, he was fishing with explosives, legally, and he was injured. So on day three, there, you can see that he has a very severe trauma to his arm. And cultures of arm revealed Pseudomonas and staph epidermidis. So they began treating with obviously, in addition to chemical and biotics, they treated with phage, your Georgian product called pFh, which contains pages that kill staph, strep pneumo, of pneumo, echolife, Proteus, and Pseudomonas. So they were basically irrigating this wound site with it, there was some improvement by day seven, as you can see, and obviously, they've, they've been doing surgery consistently to remove active tissue, dead tissue, and to try and preserve the hand. On day 10. He had some vessels rupture and repair in emergency surgery. See, but basically, you know, by six months, he's of constant phage treatment and antibiotic treatment and surgical intervention, he's able to retain his limb here. And so you know, these these sort of cases are exciting and suggest that maybe phage have a role to play in infection management, particularly and drug resistant infections. So one of the differences between phages and antibiotics, right, so there's actually quite a few. They're both tools that are used to try and kill bacteria. In phage therapy, you know, they used to treat infection logically, but they're different than chemical antibiotics in some ways. So for chemical antibiotics, you sort of need to know that the knowledge of the infectious strain, within reason, oftentimes, they'll treat with antibiotics, water waiting for cultures to come back, at least in the US. phages, you definitely need to know what strain is causing the infection, because phage are very, very specific in their killing. And so it's very easy to give the wrong phage. If you don't know what strain and actually test with strain is causing the infection phage particles are also quite large, especially compared to chemical antibiotics, maybe 10,000 times the size, at least. And so this can bring up a bunch of issues in terms of potential immune recognition, which we'll talk about in one of the compassionate cases later. dosage is critical for chemical antibiotics to lower the dose know that with a bunch of antibiotic resistant bacteria and no change in clinical status too high and you have the issue of toxicity. dose in phage is also critical, but I think it's less calculate. Generally phage treatment is a function of multiplicity of infection. So the number of pages are bacteria. And so determining does is a little bit difficult functional dose that is, but the dose is also difficult because once you've administered phage, and they start killing bacteria, they're going to replicate right so this is going to change your effective dose in the body. A resistance to phages evolves very quickly, especially individual phages. If you grow them in the lab, as you'll do in this course, you'll find that that phages, resistance to these phages evolves overnight. It with chemical antibiotics, it actually can evolve a bit slower, depending on the antibiotic, and the mechanism of resistance. Some bacteria just don't have these mechanisms in place to be resistant, so we can take quite a while to evolve them. Okay, so at about a toxicity can be very high to do relatively low, right. So there are some lastline antibiotics that are extremely toxic, but use them as a drug of last resort. phages, on the other hand, seem to have a very high therapeutic index that is that they're very appear very safe, right. So independent of dose, you don't seem to see negative side effects. And over several orders of magnitude, which is much different than you would expect from a chemical and about. So we're different ministration is variable in both chemical and bage.\n\n","    demonstrated efficacy, clear the antibiotics if demonstrated history of working, whereas phages we're working on it still, at least in the US, Canada and Western Europe. Intellectual property, which is sort of a driver for a lot of companies is trivial in antibiotics, right? You identify a new compound patent on it, and then you're okay. phages, it's different because they're, you know, considered living organisms. And so intellectual property can be a bit more\n\n","    complicated.\n\n","    And then, as I said previously, the spectrum of activity for phages is extremely narrow, oftentimes phages, in fact, one or a couple of strains, whereas chemical antibiotics, it's relatively broad, it's certainly at least compared to\n\n","    bacteria phages. So if you're going to end up trying to develop\n\n","    phage, as a therapeutic, there's a few things that want you to consider and this is clearly a not comprehensive list, but consider at least some of the right the relevant ministration is critical. Will the phage be exposed to low pH salinity? How would they get to the bacteria. So if you have a blood infection, and you give a pill, the phages exposed to the stomach, and then how many of them are actually going to cross from the digestive system into the blood? Right, this is a very important question. And you want to be sure that the phage actually get to the site so that they can do their job. immune response is a another consideration. So as I mentioned before, there are large particles, so the immune system will eventually recognize them. And navigating that space can be difficult. So you want to be sure that we're not just giving IV phage for every possible infection, because the immune system is going to be involved. Those is going to be important. So you're going to have to figure out what the best functional doses. And there's a bunch of trade offs around dosing. Obviously, there's some you might need to dilute your product down if you can't purify it as well. But also, you need to be sure that you're giving enough phage that they actually can do their job, because it's not like one phage particle, gets into a wound and then clears all the bacteria. In theory, this is what happens, what could happen at least. But in practice, this is not know what happens phage have to find a bacteria in replicating. And it's actually although you know, it appears to be a small infectious site. Viruses are ages bacteria, they're all very, very, very small, right? So even if you have bacteria, you know, a 10th of a millimeter away. That's a long distance to travel and a phage that doesn't have a way to move, it has to work on Brownian motion to end up getting there. And that's not simple as it might seem. The composition of the process and be critical. Like Are there going to be other chemicals in the phage product that are antagonistic or they kill the phage stuff to consider is the phage stable in this excipient these are things you're gonna have to test before you deploy your phage you also need to know the storage conditions for the product, for example, you know, is it gonna be refrigerated frozen, these things are all gonna be critical and be especially important as you try and develop phages in a large scale. So route of administration, as I said is critical. How, how this happens is going to be um, you know, I listed five of them here. Um, for example, eye drops. So you know, There's been phage that have just been applied a traffic to it to treat an infection. And there's you know, injection, whether it's into the circulatory system or just into muscles tissue this way. They're suppository or also by mouth. So that said, you know, pills or little capsules, you can take a phage to try and treat some infections. One that we've done a lot recently is naturalization. So, we have basically did the inhalation that phages via nebulizer a and then you know, in any other way that drugs have been delivered, and perhaps some that haven't been so what your goal should be when you're developing this product is to select a route of administration that maximizes delivery, maximizes the delivery of viable phages while minimizing the risk to the patient, if so, be a nebulizer, it, in theory will help treat a lung infection. The nebulizer itself, maybe aerosolized in the phages, damages the phages, just to be sure that page actually are functional, as they get to the discussion site is tied to the infection site. And you want to minimize the rest of the patient at the same time, obviously. Alright, so let's talk about immune response here. So as we were saying that large particles and the adaptive immune system will eventually recognize\n\n","    bacteriophage.\n\n","    So does this impact therapy? Like it might not? But as it, I would imagine, it probably does. And that's something that needs to be investigated. What happens when the age do their well, and they kill a bunch of bacteria, lice in the bacteria, and all these endo and EXO toxins just burst out of the bacteria that can elicit a pretty strong immune response. And these are things to consider when you're developing a treatment. So what about dosing? How many pages should we give? How frequently should we apply them? For example, right? So should you just give, as this cartoon suggests, you know, some agent day, one day, two day three day, or should you just throw it all in on day one, just go for it and do a one and done situation. Um, it depends on the infection, it's going to depend on severity, infection, individual patient is going to depend a lot. Um, so in terms of dosing, we're also going to talk about multiplicity of infection, as is often abbreviated m i. And it's simply the number of viral particles per bacteria in a system, right? So if you have a flask, and you're trying to, and you have 10, to the seven bacteria per mil, and there's 10 mils, there's 10 of eight total bacteria. With those 10 and eight bacteria, are you and you want an MRI of 100, you have to add 10 to the 10, platforming units of phage. Okay, so an MRI of 100 means 100, platforming units of bacteria, or phage, or bacteria. Okay, so hypothetically, if you're trying to remove 10 to the seventh bacteria from a liquid culture in a single infection cycle 10 to the seven phage is enough, right? So you're throwing one phage particle and for every bacteria nut should be sufficient to kill everyone,\n\n","    right?\n\n","    No, that's actually\n\n","    NASA do with sort of random distribution. Okay, so it's a bit of math here, it's not really critical unless you're interested in it. But it's here to illustrate sort of theory, okay. So if you look at the cosine distribution, it's the equivalent of, you know, if you have, you know, if we were actually in a different time, and we're chatting in person, and you add, you know, 100 students in this class, 10 rows of 10. And I had, you know, a bucket of 100, tennis balls and one tennis ball for each of you. And I just threw them out, you know, just took the bucket and launched it out at you. The probability that everyone gets one is very low, right, the probability that some of you get none very high probability if someone gets to is also a possibility, right. And so, when you are trying to solve these sort of, you know, hypotheticals here, you basically solve the fraction of uninfected cells which is zero. So the first equation here is the fraction of the population it's not infected. The next equation, where k equals one is the number of bacteria that are single phage. And then you know, after that, you can just look at actual infected by more than page Okay. So, um, when you do that, it will help you understand the minimum number of pages you need in order to expose all the bacteria to at least one phage particle initial administration. Okay. So for like a, you know, hypothetical example here, imagine that Jerry can actually see these are boys that are used to collect water in many parts of the world. And so, you know, in a typical Jared candidate 20 leaders say you fetched water from a river and it contains a total in this can have 10 to the nine, see if he's a video call, right, so there's a cholera outbreak upstream and down here in the water, you have cholera. So, if they're 10 to the ninth Cfu is a Vibrio, there's 5% for CFS per ml M. And if you just took 10 to that IPF use of video footage so you see knew you had a face that could kill this video, we had to tend to the night phage This is an MRI of 110 of the night face and like bacteria. When you crunch through randomly mixing and do the math, the number of bacteria that are never exposed to phage on the first encounter is 367 million CFCs. Right. So this first number here infects 20,000 people in can. So if you use mo I have one and treat. There's still enough bacteria in this can not been exposed to page. There's enough bacteria in this chair can infect 4000 people. Okay, so what if instead of 10 to the ninth, we made an MRI of 10. So we had a 10 to the 10th ef use the same jerrycan and mixed it up. We had the number of bacteria that were not exposed to a phage 450 cF use is not enough to cause an infection. In most people, the overwhelming majority people do and just for DCF use, you're not going to get an MRI of 10. If you can treat this jerrycan with ny 10 it should make it clean enough to drink. So, you know in summary that ensuring that bacteria exposed to the phage immediately upon dosing. If you're going to do that, then you need to try for MIF 10 right? Otherwise, you have to rely on either frequent dosing or replication within those and replication within the person is difficult to depend on. Is this it's just there's a lot of variables. So how do you determine the bacterial density? Right so someone comes in with you know klebsiella pneumoniae infection and pneumonia say, How do you know how many bacteria they have? Very difficult. You probably can't. But the best you can do is estimate. And then even still, it's pretty accurate. But you know, our general policy is to try and throw as many pages as possible at it while maintaining safety. And so that's sort of the approach we've taken, we've more or less standardized our dose here for some of these respiratory infections.\n\n","    But as I'd say the deaths would be completely different from other infections or even other bacteria. And we just picked a dose that sort of maximize the number of pages while minimizing the number of toxins and staying within the current FDA regulations.\n\n","    \n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["8613afc2-cb51-4029-ad65-943b5a41176a"],"content":[{"id":"8613afc2-cb51-4029-ad65-943b5a41176a","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"2514b2e7-7f71-42a4-9610-2ec5493d6414","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:02\n\n","    Hi there. Today I thought we'd talk about phage therapy. So I have a few sort of lectures will break them up into several pieces about phage therapy, and we'll talk about compassionate use cases, mostly Shauna, in another series of lectures is going to talk to you about clinical trials. I'm going to talk about more than one off cases. But we'll talk about some of the principles of face therapy before that, and we'll get to that in just a minute. So just to get you guys excited for it, I thought I'd introduce the case first. And this was the first case that we treated Yale, this was back in 2016. And it was one of the more sort of recent big cases that sort of, well, it's sort of started the momentum phage therapy, sort of helped bring it where it is, a so this case is the case of a prosthetic vascular graft infection with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And so this case started with an 80 year old male that had an aortic aneurysm. And what that is, is this vessel coming out of the heart that walls will slightly weakened, and it started bleeding out. And if this ruptures to\n\n","    catastrophic\n\n","    event, and certainly fatal, and so when there's sign of an aneurism like this, especially in the aorta, it needs to be repaired. And so what happened was this individual went under, and went to surgery and had an aortic arch replacement. And so what they did is they cut off a chunk of the aorta, and they replaced it with a piece of paper on and so they grafted this onto the aorta back in 2012. And so, you know, shortly after, after infection, and hit a, you know, a really bad infection post surgery, which spread to the sternum and actually eventually had to go in and remove the sternum and a lot of bone.\n\n","    As a result,\n\n","    in 2013, he came back to hospital with bacteremia, especially with monus. And then he also had draining fistula. So what that was, is there was basically a whole draining from his chest. He also had environment that was draining process and Pseudomonas. And its origin was a face of getting worse. When this happened, they manage this infection with iv subterra, Diem, and Cipro and then they also provided more the chest wall. And then they sent them home. But he was admitted three additional times in 2013, with, you know, increased drainage from the fistula, and bacteremia again, so he would be on antibiotics, he'd stopped taking them after the course was done. And then five days later, he would be back screaming. So for those of you that may not know what a meme is, it's when there's bacteria in the blood. So it's a pretty serious infection. Okay, so in October 2014, he had a imaging done, and it showed an increase of fluid at the base of the aorta, which is how they identified the infection site and the cultures that they pulled from the drainage or intermediate resistant to Cipro. And so they started IPsec. Again, and just as before, when he would stop taking sagacity he had fever and vektory me again. So this went on for another year. So he's been on antibiotics for, geez, two years now. And then by late 2015, actually, some blood started coming out of this fistula. And it was concerning because people thought that maybe the infection had eroded into the base of the aorta, and it was leaking a little bit. And if that happens, you know, that's the equivalent of an aneurysm rupturing. So this is a problem because, due to his advanced age, they couldn't go in and surgically remove the graft and replace it with a different\n\n","    one.\n\n","    And so, because of risk of mortality, so we were looking for alternative ways of which we might treat this case. This is our first case. We'll talk more about it later. Before we get there, I thought we'd talk about some of these a couple of historic cases. So these are from courtesy of a friend of mine from country of Georgia, who told me about these cases. And they were, these four cases happened in Georgia. And the first one is a radiation burn on those infected with Staph aureus. So this individual had a pretty severe radiation Bernice can see on a zero here, which failed to resolve after a month of hospitalization. The then treated him they started treating them with bacteria phages, with a product called h biodome, which is like a bandage that's, that contains pages for staff equal, like klebsiella, and Pseudomonas. So they basically placed this bandage on his burn daily. And then by day seven, basically, that was the the wound looked like it was improving, as you can see in the photos here, and it was less drainage of us. And when they did cultures of the wound, they saw that they were negative. So it looks like phages, in combination with antibiotics might have helped resolve\n\n","    that wound.\n\n","    And the next one is a severe wound as you can see, those infected by Pseudomonas, and this was a 46 year old male with severe trauma to the left forum. He had this injury, fishing accident, he was fishing with explosives, legally, and he was injured. So on day three, there, you can see that he has a very severe trauma to his arm. And cultures of arm revealed Pseudomonas and staph epidermidis. So they began treating with obviously, in addition to chemical and biotics, they treated with phage, your Georgian product called pFh, which contains pages that kill staph, strep pneumo, of pneumo, echolife, Proteus, and Pseudomonas. So they were basically irrigating this wound site with it, there was some improvement by day seven, as you can see, and obviously, they've, they've been doing surgery consistently to remove active tissue, dead tissue, and to try and preserve the hand. On day 10. He had some vessels rupture and repair in emergency surgery. See, but basically, you know, by six months, he's of constant phage treatment and antibiotic treatment and surgical intervention, he's able to retain his limb here. And so you know, these these sort of cases are exciting and suggest that maybe phage have a role to play in infection management, particularly and drug resistant infections. So one of the differences between phages and antibiotics, right, so there's actually quite a few. They're both tools that are used to try and kill bacteria. In phage therapy, you know, they used to treat infection logically, but they're different than chemical antibiotics in some ways.

And so it's very easy to give the wrong phage. If you don't know what strain and actually test with strain is causing the infection phage particles are also quite large, especially compared to chemical antibiotics, maybe 10,000 times the size, at least. And so this can bring up a bunch of issues in terms of potential immune recognition, which we'll talk about in one of the compassionate cases later. dosage is critical for chemical antibiotics to lower the dose know that with a bunch of antibiotic resistant bacteria and no change in clinical status too high and you have the issue of toxicity. dose in phage is also critical, but I think it's less calculate.

So there are some lastline antibiotics that are extremely toxic, but use them as a drug of last resort. phages, on the other hand, seem to have a very high therapeutic index that is that they're very appear very safe, right. So independent of dose, you don't seem to see negative side effects. And over several orders of magnitude, which is much different than you would expect from a chemical and about.

But as it, I would imagine, it probably does. And that's something that needs to be investigated. What happens when the age do their well, and they kill a bunch of bacteria, lice in the bacteria, and all these endo and EXO toxins just burst out of the bacteria that can elicit a pretty strong immune response. And these are things to consider when you're developing a treatment. So what about dosing? How many pages should we give? How frequently should we apply them? For example, right? So should you just give, as this cartoon suggests, you know, some agent day, one day, two day three day, or should you just throw it all in on day one, just go for it and do a one and done situation. Um, it depends on the infection, it's going to depend on severity, infection, individual patient is going to depend a lot. Um, so in terms of dosing, we're also going to talk about multiplicity of infection, as is often abbreviated m i. And it's simply the number of viral particles per bacteria in a system, right? So if you have a flask, and you're trying to, and you have 10, to the seven bacteria per mil, and there's 10 mils, there's 10 of eight total bacteria. With those 10 and eight bacteria, are you and you want an MRI of 100, you have to add 10 to the 10, platforming units of phage. Okay, so an MRI of 100 means 100, platforming units of bacteria, or phage, or bacteria. Okay, so hypothetically, if you're trying to remove 10 to the seventh bacteria from a liquid culture in a single infection cycle 10 to the seven phage is enough, right? So you're throwing one phage particle and for every bacteria nut should be sufficient to kill everyone,\n\n","    right?\n\n","    No, that's actually\n\n","    NASA do with sort of random distribution. Okay, so it's a bit of math here, it's not really critical unless you're interested in it. But it's here to illustrate sort of theory, okay.

And I had, you know, a bucket of 100, tennis balls and one tennis ball for each of you. And I just threw them out, you know, just took the bucket and launched it out at you. The probability that everyone gets one is very low, right, the probability that some of you get none very high probability if someone gets to is also a possibility, right. And so, when you are trying to solve these sort of, you know, hypotheticals here, you basically solve the fraction of uninfected cells which is zero. So the first equation here is the fraction of the population it's not infected. The next equation, where k equals one is the number of bacteria that are single phage. And then you know, after that, you can just look at actual infected by more than page Okay. So, um, when you do that, it will help you understand the minimum number of pages you need in order to expose all the bacteria to at least one phage particle initial administration. Okay. So for like a, you know, hypothetical example here, imagine that Jerry can actually see these are boys that are used to collect water in many parts of the world. And so, you know, in a typical Jared candidate 20 leaders say you fetched water from a river and it contains a total in this can have 10 to the nine, see if he's a video call, right, so there's a cholera outbreak upstream and down here in the water, you have cholera. So, if they're 10 to the ninth Cfu is a Vibrio, there's 5% for CFS per ml M. And if you just took 10 to that IPF use of video footage so you see knew you had a face that could kill this video, we had to tend to the night phage This is an MRI of 110 of the night face and like bacteria. When you crunch through randomly mixing and do the math, the number of bacteria that are never exposed to phage on the first encounter is 367 million CFCs. Right. So this first number here infects 20,000 people in can. So if you use mo I have one and treat. There's still enough bacteria in this can not been exposed to page. There's enough bacteria in this chair can infect 4000 people. Okay, so what if instead of 10 to the ninth, we made an MRI of 10. So we had a 10 to the 10th ef use the same jerrycan and mixed it up. We had the number of bacteria that were not exposed to a phage 450 cF use is not enough to cause an infection. In most people, the overwhelming majority people do and just for DCF use, you're not going to get an MRI of 10. If you can treat this jerrycan with ny 10 it should make it clean enough to drink. So, you know in summary that ensuring that bacteria exposed to the phage immediately upon dosing. If you're going to do that, then you need to try for MIF 10 right? Otherwise, you have to rely on either frequent dosing or replication within those and replication within the person is difficult to depend on. Is this it's just there's a lot of variables. So how do you determine the bacterial density? Right so someone comes in with you know klebsiella pneumoniae infection and pneumonia say, How do you know how many bacteria they have? Very difficult. You probably can't. But the best you can do is estimate. And then even still, it's pretty accurate. But you know, our general policy is to try and throw as many pages as possible at it while maintaining safety. And so that's sort of the approach we've taken, we've more or less standardized our dose here for some of these respiratory infections.\n\n","    But as I'd say the deaths would be completely different from other infections or even other bacteria. And we just picked a dose that sort of maximize the number of pages while minimizing the number of toxins and staying within the current FDA regulations.\n\n","    \n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["bc40b933-c203-47c4-ae29-51856035a298","4adad8e2-0b6b-45da-b351-dba62ac79713","379cfd00-36bb-4b72-a84d-7bc2aaa71280","ecf2b491-aeff-471c-9fd5-2a55711f1706","5ab54ba3-3ddb-4de9-ad3c-e91b457780ae","d599f2b3-dfd4-4955-8f1e-10ecd57bf700","9fec49c5-394c-461c-81a1-2a619e664b64","ded2f880-ca24-469e-b1a5-c363fcd18a7b","e38f2ae0-bf05-42f5-b9b8-66523c6227ac","539a4df3-adc1-46f6-a5bc-6625850d0433","1c0e2707-25f2-4240-95a6-75037e4eb289","b40487ba-5463-4246-a88c-dcb98bf65651","d563eea7-fa29-458b-a79b-dd9243fc6f42","2164e41c-42a4-432f-afd8-73c9888f84b6","7f48b1b6-6293-44b8-b4d9-3c9b409fe159","10d01556-dcaa-4476-a508-e5a395d6a439","ad9cbc73-53e7-48a7-992e-7f82fd0ae55e","41723f14-c307-4e6a-a4cf-c2c6d6197ebb","2d0ca1a3-4562-461c-b59e-42a76c66fece","b8670377-83a8-4c2f-9638-ffabff260628","2866aa70-05ec-4850-a634-e54f00657695","efb9562a-98fc-437d-a3fe-5c81e811d94c"],"content":[{"id":"bc40b933-c203-47c4-ae29-51856035a298","type":"text","value":"Ben Chan 0:02","properties":{"title":[["Ben Chan 0:02"]]},"parent_id":"8613afc2-cb51-4029-ad65-943b5a41176a","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Ben Chan 0:02\n\n"]},{"id":"4adad8e2-0b6b-45da-b351-dba62ac79713","type":"text","value":"Hi there.

Some bacteria just don't have these mechanisms in place to be resistant, so we can take quite a while to evolve them. Okay, so at about a toxicity can be very high to do relatively low, right. So there are some lastline antibiotics that are extremely toxic, but use them as a drug of last resort. phages, on the other hand, seem to have a very high therapeutic index that is that they're very appear very safe, right. So independent of dose, you don't seem to see negative side effects. And over several orders of magnitude, which is much different than you would expect from a chemical and about.

And so, you know, in a typical Jared candidate 20 leaders say you fetched water from a river and it contains a total in this can have 10 to the nine, see if he's a video call, right, so there's a cholera outbreak upstream and down here in the water, you have cholera. So, if they're 10 to the ninth Cfu is a Vibrio, there's 5% for CFS per ml M. And if you just took 10 to that IPF use of video footage so you see knew you had a face that could kill this video, we had to tend to the night phage This is an MRI of 110 of the night face and like bacteria. When you crunch through randomly mixing and do the math, the number of bacteria that are never exposed to phage on the first encounter is 367 million CFCs. Right. So this first number here infects 20,000 people in can. So if you use mo I have one and treat. There's still enough bacteria in this can not been exposed to page. There's enough bacteria in this chair can infect 4000 people. Okay, so what if instead of 10 to the ninth, we made an MRI of 10. So we had a 10 to the 10th ef use the same jerrycan and mixed it up. We had the number of bacteria that were not exposed to a phage 450 cF use is not enough to cause an infection. In most people, the overwhelming majority people do and just for DCF use, you're not going to get an MRI of 10. If you can treat this jerrycan with ny 10 it should make it clean enough to drink. So, you know in summary that ensuring that bacteria exposed to the phage immediately upon dosing. If you're going to do that, then you need to try for MIF 10 right? Otherwise, you have to rely on either frequent dosing or replication within those and replication within the person is difficult to depend on. Is this it's just there's a lot of variables. So how do you determine the bacterial density? Right so someone comes in with you know klebsiella pneumoniae infection and pneumonia say, How do you know how many bacteria they have? Very difficult. You probably can't. But the best you can do is estimate. And then even still, it's pretty accurate. But you know, our general policy is to try and throw as many pages as possible at it while maintaining safety. And so that's sort of the approach we've taken, we've more or less standardized our dose here for some of these respiratory infections.\n\n"]},{"id":"2866aa70-05ec-4850-a634-e54f00657695","type":"text","value":"But as I'd say the deaths would be completely different from other infections or even other bacteria.

And so I think it's worth actually taking a few minutes to find it. So, page binding is a pretty complicated process actually requiring recognition by the bacteria phage have specific receptor or receptors that are expressed on the surface of bacteria. So in my cartoon here, on the left, the blue face, there's bouncing around in the environment, and then the green wood is the cell wall of the bacteria, right? So it comes into contact with some protein or sugar or fat or something. If it's not the right one, it bounces back off and doesn't find it, it doesn't bind. So these receptors are present necessarily on all members of a genus, and usually not even all members of a species, right. So it is or, as we said, you know, countless times during the series, incredibly specific, eight. And so part of that specificity, a pretty good chunk of it is due to just h 90 b being able to find material, not recognizing the appropriate receptor. So, you know, once it does find the appropriate receptor, it binds to it and then continues its its reproductive process, as we discussed in previous lectures, right. So specificity as is so complicated. And it means that material failure credibly host specific, and this is good or bad. Right? So, I guess I would say it depends take difficult to get a solid answer, I know, depends, right. So, historically, it was considered bad, because you need to know a lot of information about the spectra in order to determine whether this page can be used. However, now that we're appreciating the microbiome, and we're recognizing all these like collateral damage from some of these other antimicrobials, I think we're coming to appreciate the microbiome and its value to health. And so I think the specificity, specificity is actually quite good in that it allows for like a really personalized medicine. So let's consider the specificity here, or maybe here as a form of infection. Patient pressure, right? So in this cartoon, the left of a circle of the life cycle bacteria phage, right. So in a closed system, bacteria grow phage grow, they're going to be constantly infecting the bacteria. However, within the population of bacteria, mutation, will up or standing diversity might be sufficient if it's already present, so that the phage can no longer kill trade eight. So this evolved resistance so clear that evolved resistance to particular phage could be directed right, I'm saying can be directed to reduce a reverse antibiotic resistance or possibly attenuate virulence, I mean by that is, if we're careful in choosing what the bacteria phage is using as it binds to its bacterial host, could select for a phage that utilizes some component of bacterial virulence or antibiotic resistance, such that when the bacteria mutate away from phage, and become resistant to them, it comes at a cost by being increased, seemingly sensitive to antibiotics or maybe having more sorry, decreased virulence. Right? So this lower right, is just showing that it's a trade off between phage sensitivity and antibiotic resistance are very cool. So, you know, in theory, that's great. But what about in practice? I'm going to show a few examples here on how at least in the lab, we can, we can demonstrate this trade off. Okay. So, starting with mucoid strains of Pseudomonas, right, so we have Phage, or several bacteria, Pseudomonas require now going to capsule to infect a, we'll get what that is in a minute. Here. In the bottom, I have a cartoon of Pseudomonas bacteria and those 10 colored antibodies, right. So normally, if it's swimming around in the body, antibodies can just stick on to some antigenic sites, flagging it, or destruction by the immune system. However, sometimes bacteria form a capsule. So in monus, it's more made out in it and it can actually Cover somebody\n\n","    antigenic sites, so that anybody can recognize the site anymore. Okay, well, we have phage that require a capsule in order to infect. And what the result is, is bacteria that evolve resistance to this age no longer amoeboid which could potentially be capitalized upon, you know, therapeutically, so that we can directly against New quality and perhaps work together with the immune system to help clear an infection. So in experimental work, we've shown that, you know, just just summarize that, we've shown that within three days, we can drive mucoid variants extinct with this page, which is the blue line here, and this is control phage, these different phage, which cannot infect mucoid bacteria, so this strain that we used is, has variants and amoeboid and non so right, so within a population, expose it to phage, and then we serially passaged it for three days. So in the orange line, it was a phage that cannot infect mucoid bacteria, and by the end of three days, we clearly see that mucoid bacteria are dominant, right, which makes sense, because they're resistant to page, on the blue one, the mucoid variants are sensitive to phage. And by day three, there, extinct, so everybody was none. Because this phage cannot infect non mucoid bacteria. So it's one way we can try and toggle equality in Pseudomonas, we can also target these outer membrane vesicles. So some of these outer membrane vesicles are just bits of cell wall that contain toxins, if they can promote adhesion and cause inflammation, destroy tissues, that kind of stuff. So basically, they're spewing out these little self icicles. So we have a bacteria that utilizes the O antigen, and origin of the bonus to say, in fact, in the resistant mutants do not have this antigen. And for some reason, which we're still investigating, this actually prevents them from producing remember signals. And so when we look in the supination of these bacteria that are resistant to phage. It shows evidence of this being the case,\n\n","    in that\n\n","    we look for the presence of the last days. So we did a simple last days essay, where we grew up the bacteria in the presence of Cipro flexisign, which is not known to have an impact on the last day of action. So at the end of the day, we wrote up in sub lethal concentrations of Cipro, spun it down quantify the last days and saw the last days, with erythromycin, which has been known to reduce elastase production. We grew it up, spin them down, testicle essays, it was negative, and the same thing happened with bacteria phage. satin is a it's another virulence factor secreted it causes oxidative stress and production of free radicals. it sprays out causing damage allowing the bacteria to action, we have a phage that when we expose bacteria to it and bacterial resistance, they reduce production of pass and almost zero, and I send an insect green pigment that is characteristic of Pseudomonas. We treated with sub lethal concentrations of antibiotics as well. Cipro carbenicillin, enough for my son, and this plot here is showing how much house and they are relative to the ancestor. After 48 hours, Cipro actually increased by seven, almost 50%. Relative to the ancestor, our carbon asanas was indistinguishable. erythromycin, a fourth column, the white one showed a big reduction. And then h6 is the fade all the way to right column, it should have big reduction, right? Interestingly, we were able to get rid of the increase due to Cipro by combining page of Super. Okay, so when you're designing a phage product, what's the competition gonna be like? I can use a single phage a cocktail pens, right? So it depends, like everything in therapeutics in biology. And there are cases in which a cocktail might be viable in cases in which a single phage over time might be and will hopefully try and make an argument for or single phage at the cocktail is pretty straightforward. But when we get to that point of lecture, discuss it. So if you consider the evolution of phage resistance when developing products, um, I think there can be a pretty strong case for serial model phage therapy, and we'll discuss in a minute, versus pulling them all together as a cocktail. We'll talk about that a bit later in some future slides here. But something else to consider is storage of phage. So many phases are stable for long periods of years with minimal loss of tighter at room temperature in media they were grown in. So we in the lab, one of the previous instructors of this course, Katie Wright, who's a student in the lab, she cracked open lysate of T six that was bottled in 1954, and still had locking tighter, and this is the year 2020. Um, so you know, 50, more than 50 years, at room temperature in, you know, liriope broth, and this still has pocking, tighter. And other faiths that we have, you know, within a week, we're down one order of magnitude. So it really is phage dependent. powdered formulations can be very, very, very stable, right? This, the ees laflife page can be stable for theoretically, you know, hundreds of years. Um, however, it can be costly to produce and optimize them to get the right sugar content. And you do lose some faith at the beginning, just as you would, if you were to store them at minus 80, you lose a bunch of pages beginning but then they're stable for basically forever until you rehydrate them or when you lose a bit more, but stability is definitely, um, the liquid formulation to be stable require more space also, right. So if your lab size is limited, and you need to store 10,000, phage, and you know, 100 ml eloquence, and take up a lot of space,\n\n","    um,\n\n","    however, and definitely, if you're going to ship these around, it can get costly to ship them. So that's another issue to consider.\n\n","    So\n\n","    I'll stop the second here. But, you know, consider the possibility of using multiple phages, Senior Center, but different parts of their center, right, avoid issues resistance, waiting a trade off. So what happens if you use all phage? targeting opsi? Right, that's really strong selection against the expression. So I would predict the deletion of this gene. Continued strong, strong, selective pressure. Best of luck to try your own. And maybe by the time you see this lecture, we'll have a couple of papers out showing the difference between cereal age and cocktails in the works\n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["cad46df2-4dbd-46d2-be8d-fcc4a18a4441"],"content":[{"id":"cad46df2-4dbd-46d2-be8d-fcc4a18a4441","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"bc9ac4cb-a3c1-446e-a524-794493aec2c2","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:01\n\n","    Okay, so to continue some lectures on phage therapy, again, my contact information is at the bottom if you feel the need to email or choppy instrument. so critical to phage therapy is actually age binding, it's really important biologically and may be a source of a lot of stages.

So it comes into contact with some protein or sugar or fat or something. If it's not the right one, it bounces back off and doesn't find it, it doesn't bind. So these receptors are present necessarily on all members of a genus, and usually not even all members of a species, right. So it is or, as we said, you know, countless times during the series, incredibly specific, eight. And so part of that specificity, a pretty good chunk of it is due to just h 90 b being able to find material, not recognizing the appropriate receptor. So, you know, once it does find the appropriate receptor, it binds to it and then continues its its reproductive process, as we discussed in previous lectures, right. So specificity as is so complicated. And it means that material failure credibly host specific, and this is good or bad. Right? So, I guess I would say it depends take difficult to get a solid answer, I know, depends, right.

Right. And in order to get to the national cases, I thought we'd start off talking about\n\n","    involved.\n\n","    And just for, you know, example, we'll talk about Pseudomonas, because this is bacteria that said, spend\n\n","    So if you look at these effects, mumps and Pseudomonas called, most of them are Mac's, which that's multi response. And then they're named like max AB, okay, so that just has to deal with Max's multidrug efflux, and then a B would be the inner and transmembrane protein names. And then OPR is our membrane protein and then so other name so that they existed before chemical antibiotics were developed by humans, they, they do pump them out, and to pump out solvents, dyes, biocides cell signaling molecules, they're just great stuff. So no, factory, sorry, material kicks in and out of otic, but they recognize it.\n\n","    And of these six, four of them use the same outer membrane component OPR, as you can see here with this red letters,\n\n","    and these pumps, at least the OPR m gene is under stabilizing selection. This gentleman here in the lower left corner is named Mark sistrum. He works for me as an assistant professor at University of California, Merced said, and he analyzed genomes of all published Pseudomonas, specifically looking at remembering protein M. and found this under strong stabilizing selection, which means is highly conserved. So it's very similar in Pseudomonas, you pull from sewer versus UTI versus plant infection, all using the same OPR.\n\n","    And, you know, some of our earlier work showed that we tested a bunch of isolates from all over sewage, you know, infections, UTI, dog ear infections that were sensitive to the phage. And we tested the MRC. So that's the minimum inhibitory concentration of several antibiotics in three different groups broadly, those that efflux provides resistance, those that effects may provide resistance or provide some resistance, and then those three folks does not provide resistance. Right. So you'll see here in third column the MSE of\n\n","    these bacteria to these\n\n","    antibiotics. We then exposed it to phage on cat one and pulled resistant colonies from where we grew up those resistant bacteria tested MIT again and we got the following results right. So, we have a reduction of micc in the ones where effects provide resistance, big reduction, medium reduction in those where effects make fragile sense and no change where you know, existence okay. So, in several of these actually showed reversion from clinical resistance to susceptibility Alright, so, to confirm this receptor, and this is the this sort of work is stuff that you can do for like, all phages that just those using these, you know, remember, this, I mean, should probably do for all the phages discovery, you should at least know the receptor stability, its genomes, you know, all these things, right. So, just as an assembler determinant, we used a transpose on knockout we tense so basically a transposable element is inserted in, in the genes. So in this, we test it against one where transposons inserted in the atom every m gene. And we also tested this max R, which is the repressor of C flux system. So, for these e flux xenobiotics, the wild type is resistant, the knockout had a increased sensitivity. And then the repressor one is knocked out as a is still resistant, as you would expect. Something which is not a fluxed. That unchanged. We then tested face sensitivity and found that it was at the oprf knockout was resistant to facial hair culture sensitive,\n\n","    perfect strongly suggest that's the receptor. So we did this over time also with a reader. So the Y, I'm going to show you a plot here where the y axis is cell density as measured by od 600. And then time across the x eight, so when so should be color coordinated here. But you look at the wild type with ethos capable in the presence of subinhibitory\n\n","    Okay, so now let's jump way back to another section of lectures when I was talking about the very first case, right, so this is the case of the aortic aneurysm. We talked about that lectures ago. I told you we get back to it. Now the point we're getting back to\n\n","    Getting reagents that grew up resistant to the phage and we tested the MRC again, and we saw a big decrease in Cipro, gentamicin tobramycin. And also some testing. As we saw a general improvement in bio sensitivities of black bars in Cipro, gentamicin and Bryson represent clinical breakpoints for these drugs. So what we saw is reversion from clinical resistance to sensitivity to these drugs, simply by involves page resistance.\n\n","    So I took the data to the surgeons and they were like, awesome, this is what we need to do. Let's treat this guy, right. So you know if you're going to develop a therapy, this is like basic identifying like you have it's therapy. You sample you tested sensitivity of the bacteria isolate seven\n\n","    strains ideally, in a well characterized library, grow up the phage, concentrate, phage endotoxin, and EXO toxins dialyze it, you know, contaminants, prepare to doses and then confirm the low endotoxin concentration, and then you should be ready to go. Right. So I realized I say it like it's some simple tasks, means one of the steps requires a lot of work. But it's certainly something can be done in most labs.\n\n","    Well, that was not possible. So we tried doing this for three hours in the theater, and we were unable to puncture this, this little collection of fluid, do heavy scarring. So you know, it like obsessed and like, walled off, and it was scarring.\n\n","    So we did that and discharged him four weeks post procedure, he developed a bunch of bleeding from that fistula, and, you know, very concerning, right, because you're like, Oh, my God, the,\n\n","    because of this illness, where the physicians there, identify that pinkeye, pseudocyst and drain so they saw these little systems as they drained them, and they pulled us into the vector bahmani. Right. So they stabilized in there with some antibiotics. And then they flew him to California for treatment. And by time he ended up in California, this bug was actually Pandora resistant, which means is resistant to the available chemical antibiotics.\n\n","    So this point, they started working on a potential phage treatment. And they just were administered for eight weeks, I believe, 16 weeks, sorry, 16 weeks via washing the abscess areas and by IP. Let me see what goes on there. What they gave.\n\n","    They were also this guy was also given several endo biotics via IV vancomycin meropenem cost into cycling. And they also added azithromycin on day 36 of his treatment. This is combination of work between several groups went to Texas, the Navy, California\n\n","    And the bottom blue line, there is the duration of IV therapy with phage. Right, and the pots on the right are growth charts similar to the one I showed you previously.\n\n","    It's similar to this right, so similar optical density over time, this is using a proprietary technology by one of the authors on the paper, that is functionally the equivalent\n\n","    So with this case, they also were able to pull blood samples because the guy was admitted in hospital. So it's pretty straightforward, the easy blood. And they found that faders were actually readily removed from serum. So you know, they took control minus five minutes, five minutes, 30 minutes, 6183 60. And then they pulled blood, and they quantified age. And they found you know, before face every there's no age, see, in five minutes, they had one point 10 fourth pfds per mil,\n\n","    by 30 minutes, it was down to four times in a third an hour, it was almost undetectable, and one. So within an hour they're gone from. And also importantly, is that serum collected at the end of the study showed neutralizing antibodies. So they basically found that the antibody immune system had recognized the phages in the cocktail and would kill them. So this is by the end of the study. I don't know if it determined the point at which this happened. But by 16 weeks, it was resistant. By day eight, the blood cultures were all resistant to the phages test as far as I understand. But they continued using IV phage. In case there was some there were still sensitive. Following 16 weeks of fake treatment, including a six week coma, he just woke up one day. And he's been working ever since he looks great. He's out talking. You can Google him, he's he's a very nice guy. And you can read all about it, hear all about it on YouTube, with his wife on the left, she's written a book about it. And you can find this on Google. And so that's that's the case in California. So after that case, we ended up creating quite a few pulmonary cases. So because of a press from that case, and in our prior one, we started getting contacted by a bunch of individuals or physicians with cases that they were treating or their sub selves and family members with infections that they were looking for alternatives because the cases I'm about to tell you are, are of those flavors. This one we'll call case was a young woman with cystic fibrosis. So it's a genetic disease that results in, you know, thick mucus production, and they are prone to pulmonary infections. So in this case, right here, this woman had chronic pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa that's, you know, that's a very, very common bacteria in cystic fibrosis, okay. So she historically had a baseline febe one, which is the forced expiratory volume of air that individuals breathe out at one second\n\n","    of 90%. So that just means that she had 90% lung function of someone without CF of her age and sex. Okay. So this was how up until 2015, she had this 90 or greater, right so then from 2015 to 2017. She was stable in the 80s with a slight decline and then it went In 17, she was sent to an adult CF center. So she's transitioning into adult care where they gave her some IV antibiotics to increase trying to increase her pulmonary function. And so these lung infections are rough, right? Because they basically, in the airways, they get an infection, which causes inflammation and tissue damage, which damages the circulation and allows the infection to get bigger. And so basically, it's a progressive disease where it feeds back on itself, in part because a lot of these virulence factors that are secreted so I'm going to show you a plot of this young woman's, if he wants to help as a proxy for lung function, okay, so she got this iv causton, here in the in January 2017, that she's in the skill center.\n\n","    And then it dipped a little bit. She had a little exacerbation and went down, but she got more IVs. And then it recovered. Right, so this gray bar here is when she's in the hospital.\n\n","    So she got hospitalized the gave her iv causton. She's great. He started declining in when she got out. So as I need to gave her more IV antibiotics, here's a triple combo. So they gave her that during a hospitalization and almost immediately she presented with australium. With CF, okay, that's very common, when you deplete someone's microbiome with all these antibiotics, a lot of times see this, which cause further problems. And then such a partial lung collapse here. Then once she was discharged, she's gradually was improving. So then in October, she had 14 days of IV antibiotics, her lung function continued to decline. And as at this point, that they contacted us about phage because of the resistance profile, and the fact that antibiotics didn't seem to work. So if you look at the section right here, blowing up a little bit, okay, so they pulled back here from her speed. And so she coughed up. And they cultured bacteria out of it, and they quantified it as for us, so these are semi quantitative method, they found more, so that's a very heavy infection. They call to the bacteria and to be resistant all these antibiotics, right? It treated with iv causton and tezo. continued to decline. You can see it was continuing to be resistant. They finished antibiotics and her lung function still was going down, suggesting that it wasn't doing any, hey, we initiated phage therapy right here, it's not a sample of bacteria. So, we had received bacteria for sputum. And I wrote it in a biofilm to test it. So I equate this bacteria in a biofilm and then I treated with either phage H plus antibiotic and aquatic alone just to control I let it sit for 24 hours and I sonicated it out for the bacteria right. So I found that phage alone decreased one order of magnitude bacteria, H plus antibiotic two orders of magnitude and then antibiotic and the control identical, okay, so it helps it doesn't look much on the plot here because a log scale right? But it did kill 90% of the bacteria within 24 hours, okay. So it degraded some biofilm. Alright, so below that is a plot of the MSE of the surviving bacteria. And we found that in the cases where it was exposed to phage at all, it had a seriously decreased micc to about it was even pregnant is that for my son? So this bacteriophage can help degrade biofilms and improve the antibiotic sensitivity of Pseudomonas isolates and clinical isolates too. So, um, so we tested this is I just talked about this, but we saw two orders of magnitude reduction with H plus exposure and then a reduction in antibiotic resistance as well.\n\n","    Right, so we started as I said, Here, we started phage therapy a week, and then we called your battery out and we found increased increased sensitivity so Cipro now intermediate resistance level foxes in intermediate capacity, 17, tezo, and imipenem. It's sensitive. So we've opened up several antibiotics that we can use to treat a chicken came back a couple months, cultured again, sensitive to almost all these antibiotics, also know her lung function once we initiated phage therapy, her lung full jumped up 10% and then it continued to increase back to 80. Okay. So she had a bunch of, you know, responses, she had an increase in nuke split production. She lost her car, she had a little bit of a eight week after he had all this increased energy joined the gym, lung, sun and clear. However, her lungs continue to produce Pseudomonas as you expect them individually, CF. Healthcare is no longer drug resistant. It's been geez almost three years now and her FPV is actually above 90%. Now, she said zero exacerbation sense. So it's kept her in the hospital for years with this great lung function. So it's entirely possible fH really have a strong role here. And so from this case, things went really crazy. And people were all over contacting us about treatment, especially for pulmonary function. So pulmonary infections, specially those with CF. Okay, so she, you know, I often get asked, Oh, is it trade off a replacement because a lot of these lungs, especially cystic fibrosis, it's a really complicated community of many strains of Pseudomonas and other bacteria. And so the question is, often did you just kill the drug resistant ones? And then the drug sensitive ones grew up? Or were you causing some evolution happening inside the lungs? I think it's both actually. The original sputum had multiple phenotypes. Unsurprisingly, unsurprising. But by the end, it was basically a single isolate single strain. However, that's a replacement, strong suggestive of a replacement. However, in the lab, when I take these strains and expose them to phage, I can see a change in MSE to tobramycin. Also, so there's an improvement in sensitivities due to selection. So it's probably both there's a trade off happening as of evolution and lung. There's also a placement of by these less resistant strains are allowed to grow up with the niches opened up. So yeah, now we're way out there, she's got a really high ABV no hospitalizations, notes, so patients, um, so she's doing great. And she's, she's also been in the press quite a bit. She's, she's great, we still hang out there, and we're in touch pretty frequently. And so definitely read up on her case, if you're interested. There's a lot online. Her name is Paige Rogers, so you can watch it below documentaries about her. Um, and so so that really got people excited in the possibility of treating CF infections with with age. Um, so there are several other cases we treated. But after this owner infection that we treated, we basically set up the fH center. I thought I'd take a few minutes here and talk about the H Center. So we have a basic treatment algorithm where we you know, we have people coming in from all across the country or obviously, within Yale health system. With infection treated, we basically identified bacteria in Canada, phage. Syria, we select phage. In device treatment plants, we do an ultra personalized approach, we were very specific on what phages we use and for how long based on lab data, we're doing actual science, where we say, oh, use this page for four days, and then this one for three, and then this combination for another four days, and you have the highest likelihood of doing the bacteria reducing resistance and increasing sensitivity. Or maybe we're targeting virulence to all these things, we select the agent\n\n","    that we deploy the phage, right, so we have them all prepared in in a medically appropriate way. And they're pure enough to be used therapeutically. We treat the individuals and then we monitor changes, right? So a lot of these case reports, they're not doing science, but there's throwing the phage and they're saying, Oh, they got better. It was the page. We're actually monitoring changes. Okay. We have microbiome data for all these lung samples, we're looking at clinical changes in terms of lung function, we're looking at immune response, we're looking at evolution within the lung, we're looking at evolution within the wounds, we're looking at changes in terms of age sensitivity, we're looking at changes in antibiotic sensitivity, obviously, we're looking at changes in the production of these virulence factors during all this, so we really, really well what each page is doing inside the body. Okay. So, when we're selecting phage, we grew up the bacteria, right? And you turn it sensitivity, as I just said, in large Linux spectrums. We talked about this, maybe a few lectures back about determining a sensitivity on it, and then we select the appropriate range. So we have a big library phages at Yale, you know, in the thousands, when and we basically I isolate them constantly from all over the world and we select phages will make all of them but we select pages with relevant clinical and clinically meaning over sectors, right? You're trying to find phages that would make good therapy candidates because not all phages Well, even if phage kills bacteria really well, it might not be a good therapeutic candidate actually increased drug resistance, increase variance, we have to be very careful that we do this properly, or else we can cause disease towards a so we looking at this page for clinically clinically meaningful receptors, for example, antibody, efflux motility, virulence factor production, right? So, for example, let's just look at this page. We talked about a previously made targets antibiotic efflux, right? So you grew up bacteria. Supposing the phage, right, and then you've sequenced the bacteria to come out, and you quantify the number of mutate mutations that occur along the genome. You say, Ah, this guy has a bunch of mutations in efflux. Awesome, it did its job. We have another phage that targets tech for us, which is for motility. involved in motility and some virulence factor production. Actually, you do the same thing grew up the bacteria, explosive phage, select resistant mutants sequence those guys, you see a bunch of mutations in four pillars, exactly as you'd expect.\n\n","    The same thing for trying to reduce inflammation and maybe work synergistically with immune system, we might target the entity, right, so we do the same thing as the previous study. And these mutations are in LPs. Right now we have these three really good pages that we use therapeutically. So let's make a cocktail out of them. Right? Let's just take these three targets, three different virulence factors, pull them together, make a cocktail.\n\n","    The same thing is a cocktail growed up. If the resistant mutants, what do you see?\n\n","    Ah, it's not mutations in anabolic effects pills and MPs, as mutations in the capsule and mismatch repair is exactly what we didn't want. Resistant mutants in this case, are harder to kill by white blood cells, they have increased antibiotic resistance and increased chance of invading new tissues, this is gonna make the disease much worse using this cocktail, right. So what happens if we do it in series? This is my case for serial MonaVie therapy. You are the first page targets and resistant mutants that come out of all these mutations in flux, right? Take the strain, expose it to the next page. Boom, see the mutations in the pelisse. Right, hit it with the last page, we see all the changes in LPs surviving population now has decreased antibiotic resistance, decreased virulence and decreased ability to invade new niches and tissues and increased consumption by white blood cells. Right? So this can work synergistically with the immune system. Obviously, we're not always in a privileged position to to come up with a page cocktail and treat them see. Sorry, come on phages treat in series like this, for all cases, this works in chronic infections with high likelihood of recon ization or reinfection, right? If it's an acute and pen resistant infection that's very severe, you might not have the liberty to do this. And so just throw the cocktail at it, kill off a bunch of bacteria, control inflammation, come back with a new cocktail because your library should have hundreds of different foods, you can always find a new cocktail to use in series.\n\n","    So using this approach of serial monitor phage therapy, I'll talk about few other cases here. Right so this is a 16 year old girl with cystic fibrosis and has lung disease or pulmonary function. And she was experiencing it's pretty severe exacerbation. How does isn't Pseudomonas intervene with phage. Here again, pre and post junk sensitivities are here in the table on the left pod is the same as before and FPV one, so she started off with much lower lung function with some mild increase. But we did see a very rapid reduction of speed of bacteria density, two orders of magnitude reduced. And she returned to her baseline, C reactive protein and white blood cells after a week so suggesting that the phage intervention had helped with inflammation. Alright, so a couple more cases here so we treated a 26 year old woman with CF Same as before and resistance to monus. In her case, we were looking for a way that we can be open sensitivity to meropenem. So treated her here. You can see this plot is the green line is when based therapies and used in the pre therapy so I've had the privilege of getting sputum before treatment. quantified bacteria didn't see a change in speed and density. We asked phage and immediately saw a big reduction of Pseudomonas. In this case, it looks like nearly three orders of magnitude. And then the bacteria that grew out of that were sensitive to meropenem again, so she was able to get out of hospital. She's also been in the media quite a bit. My name's Ella. You can Google Ella Lhasa, and you'll see all about her story. But she actually stayed out of the hospital for quite a while with this benefit from page, all right case, blow this is an elderly gentleman with COPD and a massive lung abscess requiring surgical intervention. But the surgeons wouldn't touch the case because, you know, massive abscess and there was a big risk of opening them up the infection spread. So they had retweeted this guy with phage. And we have a pre age density of 10 to the six PS CFS per mil, we treated with the only antibiotic was sensitive to and actually, on the day we treated with phage. It was toward the end of that course of antibiotics and his bacterial load actually had gone up two orders of magnitude. We started with phage and immediately saw a big reduction in bacteria density, almost four orders of magnitude and re sensitization that America and he saw some improvement on imaging to the point where surgeons would once again consider the case for removal of abscess.\n\n","    Okay, just a couple more quick ones here with another non CF bronchiectasis this man was injured in a house fire with a lot of smoke 40 years ago, and then had a chronic lung lung infections ever since because a lung tissue was damaged. So his Pseudomonas was resistant to every chemical on ionic, even those in trials. And so he came to us about age, which he did this individual ice. So the first case here on the applaud this the first green section, we saw a big reduction of\n\n","    speed of density and bacteria, three orders of magnitude reduction.\n\n","    And then we treated him again a couple months later, and we saw another reduction of bacteria to the point of where it's below limit detection by the lab and this was a 16 year infection that is eradicated it's important to say that you see the two cultures here on the left. Um, that's the color of the bacteria before treatment and after treatment CCNA reduction of the production of Prasanna which is which is one of virulence factors talked about earlier in this lecture. So we actually made a prediction in the lab of what would happen, I created a visual saw what happened on the on the on the back end of that and actually matched our prediction. Okay, k seven down here is a 38 year old woman with CF. panners isn't Pseudomonas. Again, same stories before we treated with phage targeting pls, which was involved in Prasanna production, we saw an immediate reduction, two orders of magnitude reduction speed and density bacteria. And then we saw an improvement to separate floxin. So she could use that again, and a little bit of an improvement in FPV. One, you see the plates below here are actually agency sensitivity plates we took to some of our top phages. before, during and after phage therapy so the top is before things or screen during therapy is less screen and then after that, if you see three strains that we pulled that were completely devoid, so it's exactly as we would have predicted would have happened.\n\n","    Okay, so just some quick conclusions about this. This least with the with the work we're doing at Yale is that face can force clinically meaningful trade offs in vitro. Okay, lab essays can inform clinical decisions, especially regarding environment selection, we can work with clinicians to identify which pages will work best with certain antibiotics to optimize treatment, okay. Next bring phage treatment, they can be deployed safely and effectively seen zero severe adverse events, no bronchospasm nothing. And they can be deployed effectively to treat these infections, changes in bacterial community during phage therapy can be potentially predicted based on lab essays and CNN with inflammation with drug flux, we can make a prediction and it looks like it works to people. Okay. So, terms of outcome, clinically, clinically meaningful trade offs can be forced in vivo, right? So we can cause bacteria to be drug sensitive again, and cause them to stop producing some of these virulence factors. Okay, so changes in status, therefore, like in terms of improvement, maybe improve lung function, health can be attributed to a phage based intervention. However, in the absence of placebo controlled clinical trials, we can't definitively make that claim. We have a clinical trial that by the time this airs We started, we received permission from FDA to start, we're just finishing manufacturing today. That trial world isn't cystic fibrosis, we're going to work there. And we have two trials planned every year after that. And we're going to be working in different bacteria, different diseases. But until we get these clinical trials up and running, we can't make any claims. So this is where I would normally take questions. However, I obviously can't message me, but you can through email. It's been like every one of my lectures, or Instagram. This is a picture of some of the people in the lab, and then a Venn diagram of a center Gail, where we involve education of med students, grad students, clinical lab scientists, doing actual scientific research on the medical side, clinical trial research, we're doing bench science, and then we're actually doing clinical trials and clinical research. So with that, I think I'm gonna jump to some other\n\n","    topics at another time. But again, if you have any questions, feel free to email me and pretty quickly replying\n\n","    \n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["73287f3c-b49a-4300-9030-49985548978b"],"content":[{"id":"73287f3c-b49a-4300-9030-49985548978b","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"c51e6ef3-5944-458f-8faa-5156e0b14ae3","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:01\n\n","    All right, so now let's talk about some of these cases. Right. And in order to get to the national cases, I thought we'd start off talking about\n\n","    involved.\n\n","    And just for, you know, example, we'll talk about Pseudomonas, because this is bacteria that said, spend\n\n","    So if you look at these effects, mumps and Pseudomonas called, most of them are Mac's, which that's multi response. And then they're named like max AB, okay, so that just has to deal with Max's multidrug efflux, and then a B would be the inner and transmembrane protein names. And then OPR is our membrane protein and then so other name so that they existed before chemical antibiotics were developed by humans, they, they do pump them out, and to pump out solvents, dyes, biocides cell signaling molecules, they're just great stuff. So no, factory, sorry, material kicks in and out of otic, but they recognize it.\n\n","    And of these six, four of them use the same outer membrane component OPR, as you can see here with this red letters,\n\n","    and these pumps, at least the OPR m gene is under stabilizing selection. This gentleman here in the lower left corner is named Mark sistrum. He works for me as an assistant professor at University of California, Merced said, and he analyzed genomes of all published Pseudomonas, specifically looking at remembering protein M. and found this under strong stabilizing selection, which means is highly conserved. So it's very similar in Pseudomonas, you pull from sewer versus UTI versus plant infection, all using the same OPR.\n\n","    And, you know, some of our earlier work showed that we tested a bunch of isolates from all over sewage, you know, infections, UTI, dog ear infections that were sensitive to the phage. And we tested the MRC. So that's the minimum inhibitory concentration of several antibiotics in three different groups broadly, those that efflux provides resistance, those that effects may provide resistance or provide some resistance, and then those three folks does not provide resistance. Right. So you'll see here in third column the MSE of\n\n","    these bacteria to these\n\n","    antibiotics. We then exposed it to phage on cat one and pulled resistant colonies from where we grew up those resistant bacteria tested MIT again and we got the following results right. So, we have a reduction of micc in the ones where effects provide resistance, big reduction, medium reduction in those where effects make fragile sense and no change where you know, existence okay. So, in several of these actually showed reversion from clinical resistance to susceptibility Alright, so, to confirm this receptor, and this is the this sort of work is stuff that you can do for like, all phages that just those using these, you know, remember, this, I mean, should probably do for all the phages discovery, you should at least know the receptor stability, its genomes, you know, all these things, right. So, just as an assembler determinant, we used a transpose on knockout we tense so basically a transposable element is inserted in, in the genes. So in this, we test it against one where transposons inserted in the atom every m gene. And we also tested this max R, which is the repressor of C flux system. So, for these e flux xenobiotics, the wild type is resistant, the knockout had a increased sensitivity. And then the repressor one is knocked out as a is still resistant, as you would expect. Something which is not a fluxed. That unchanged. We then tested face sensitivity and found that it was at the oprf knockout was resistant to facial hair culture sensitive,\n\n","    perfect strongly suggest that's the receptor. So we did this over time also with a reader. So the Y, I'm going to show you a plot here where the y axis is cell density as measured by od 600. And then time across the x eight, so when so should be color coordinated here. But you look at the wild type with ethos capable in the presence of subinhibitory\n\n","    Okay, so now let's jump way back to another section of lectures when I was talking about the very first case, right, so this is the case of the aortic aneurysm. We talked about that lectures ago. I told you we get back to it. Now the point we're getting back to\n\n","    Getting reagents that grew up resistant to the phage and we tested the MRC again, and we saw a big decrease in Cipro, gentamicin tobramycin. And also some testing. As we saw a general improvement in bio sensitivities of black bars in Cipro, gentamicin and Bryson represent clinical breakpoints for these drugs. So what we saw is reversion from clinical resistance to sensitivity to these drugs, simply by involves page resistance.\n\n","    So I took the data to the surgeons and they were like, awesome, this is what we need to do. Let's treat this guy, right. So you know if you're going to develop a therapy, this is like basic identifying like you have it's therapy. You sample you tested sensitivity of the bacteria isolate seven\n\n","    strains ideally, in a well characterized library, grow up the phage, concentrate, phage endotoxin, and EXO toxins dialyze it, you know, contaminants, prepare to doses and then confirm the low endotoxin concentration, and then you should be ready to go. Right. So I realized I say it like it's some simple tasks, means one of the steps requires a lot of work. But it's certainly something can be done in most labs.\n\n","    Well, that was not possible. So we tried doing this for three hours in the theater, and we were unable to puncture this, this little collection of fluid, do heavy scarring. So you know, it like obsessed and like, walled off, and it was scarring.\n\n","    So we did that and discharged him four weeks post procedure, he developed a bunch of bleeding from that fistula, and, you know, very concerning, right, because you're like, Oh, my God, the,\n\n","    because of this illness, where the physicians there, identify that pinkeye, pseudocyst and drain so they saw these little systems as they drained them, and they pulled us into the vector bahmani. Right. So they stabilized in there with some antibiotics. And then they flew him to California for treatment. And by time he ended up in California, this bug was actually Pandora resistant, which means is resistant to the available chemical antibiotics.\n\n","    So this point, they started working on a potential phage treatment. And they just were administered for eight weeks, I believe, 16 weeks, sorry, 16 weeks via washing the abscess areas and by IP. Let me see what goes on there. What they gave.\n\n","    They were also this guy was also given several endo biotics via IV vancomycin meropenem cost into cycling. And they also added azithromycin on day 36 of his treatment. This is combination of work between several groups went to Texas, the Navy, California\n\n","    And the bottom blue line, there is the duration of IV therapy with phage. Right, and the pots on the right are growth charts similar to the one I showed you previously.\n\n","    It's similar to this right, so similar optical density over time, this is using a proprietary technology by one of the authors on the paper, that is functionally the equivalent\n\n","    So with this case, they also were able to pull blood samples because the guy was admitted in hospital. So it's pretty straightforward, the easy blood. And they found that faders were actually readily removed from serum. So you know, they took control minus five minutes, five minutes, 30 minutes, 6183 60. And then they pulled blood, and they quantified age. And they found you know, before face every there's no age, see, in five minutes, they had one point 10 fourth pfds per mil,\n\n","    by 30 minutes, it was down to four times in a third an hour, it was almost undetectable, and one. So within an hour they're gone from. And also importantly, is that serum collected at the end of the study showed neutralizing antibodies. So they basically found that the antibody immune system had recognized the phages in the cocktail and would kill them. So this is by the end of the study. I don't know if it determined the point at which this happened. But by 16 weeks, it was resistant. By day eight, the blood cultures were all resistant to the phages test as far as I understand. But they continued using IV phage. In case there was some there were still sensitive. Following 16 weeks of fake treatment, including a six week coma, he just woke up one day. And he's been working ever since he looks great. He's out talking. You can Google him, he's he's a very nice guy. And you can read all about it, hear all about it on YouTube, with his wife on the left, she's written a book about it. And you can find this on Google. And so that's that's the case in California. So after that case, we ended up creating quite a few pulmonary cases. So because of a press from that case, and in our prior one, we started getting contacted by a bunch of individuals or physicians with cases that they were treating or their sub selves and family members with infections that they were looking for alternatives because the cases I'm about to tell you are, are of those flavors. This one we'll call case was a young woman with cystic fibrosis. So it's a genetic disease that results in, you know, thick mucus production, and they are prone to pulmonary infections. So in this case, right here, this woman had chronic pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa that's, you know, that's a very, very common bacteria in cystic fibrosis, okay. So she historically had a baseline febe one, which is the forced expiratory volume of air that individuals breathe out at one second\n\n","    of 90%. So that just means that she had 90% lung function of someone without CF of her age and sex. Okay. So this was how up until 2015, she had this 90 or greater, right so then from 2015 to 2017. She was stable in the 80s with a slight decline and then it went In 17, she was sent to an adult CF center. So she's transitioning into adult care where they gave her some IV antibiotics to increase trying to increase her pulmonary function. And so these lung infections are rough, right? Because they basically, in the airways, they get an infection, which causes inflammation and tissue damage, which damages the circulation and allows the infection to get bigger. And so basically, it's a progressive disease where it feeds back on itself, in part because a lot of these virulence factors that are secreted so I'm going to show you a plot of this young woman's, if he wants to help as a proxy for lung function, okay, so she got this iv causton, here in the in January 2017, that she's in the skill center.\n\n","    And then it dipped a little bit. She had a little exacerbation and went down, but she got more IVs. And then it recovered. Right, so this gray bar here is when she's in the hospital.\n\n","    So she got hospitalized the gave her iv causton. She's great. He started declining in when she got out. So as I need to gave her more IV antibiotics, here's a triple combo. So they gave her that during a hospitalization and almost immediately she presented with australium. With CF, okay, that's very common, when you deplete someone's microbiome with all these antibiotics, a lot of times see this, which cause further problems. And then such a partial lung collapse here. Then once she was discharged, she's gradually was improving. So then in October, she had 14 days of IV antibiotics, her lung function continued to decline. And as at this point, that they contacted us about phage because of the resistance profile, and the fact that antibiotics didn't seem to work. So if you look at the section right here, blowing up a little bit, okay, so they pulled back here from her speed. And so she coughed up. And they cultured bacteria out of it, and they quantified it as for us, so these are semi quantitative method, they found more, so that's a very heavy infection. They call to the bacteria and to be resistant all these antibiotics, right? It treated with iv causton and tezo. continued to decline. You can see it was continuing to be resistant. They finished antibiotics and her lung function still was going down, suggesting that it wasn't doing any, hey, we initiated phage therapy right here, it's not a sample of bacteria. So, we had received bacteria for sputum. And I wrote it in a biofilm to test it. So I equate this bacteria in a biofilm and then I treated with either phage H plus antibiotic and aquatic alone just to control I let it sit for 24 hours and I sonicated it out for the bacteria right. So I found that phage alone decreased one order of magnitude bacteria, H plus antibiotic two orders of magnitude and then antibiotic and the control identical, okay, so it helps it doesn't look much on the plot here because a log scale right? But it did kill 90% of the bacteria within 24 hours, okay. So it degraded some biofilm. Alright, so below that is a plot of the MSE of the surviving bacteria. And we found that in the cases where it was exposed to phage at all, it had a seriously decreased micc to about it was even pregnant is that for my son? So this bacteriophage can help degrade biofilms and improve the antibiotic sensitivity of Pseudomonas isolates and clinical isolates too. So, um, so we tested this is I just talked about this, but we saw two orders of magnitude reduction with H plus exposure and then a reduction in antibiotic resistance as well.\n\n","    Right, so we started as I said, Here, we started phage therapy a week, and then we called your battery out and we found increased increased sensitivity so Cipro now intermediate resistance level foxes in intermediate capacity, 17, tezo, and imipenem. It's sensitive. So we've opened up several antibiotics that we can use to treat a chicken came back a couple months, cultured again, sensitive to almost all these antibiotics, also know her lung function once we initiated phage therapy, her lung full jumped up 10% and then it continued to increase back to 80. Okay. So she had a bunch of, you know, responses, she had an increase in nuke split production. She lost her car, she had a little bit of a eight week after he had all this increased energy joined the gym, lung, sun and clear. However, her lungs continue to produce Pseudomonas as you expect them individually, CF. Healthcare is no longer drug resistant. It's been geez almost three years now and her FPV is actually above 90%. Now, she said zero exacerbation sense. So it's kept her in the hospital for years with this great lung function. So it's entirely possible fH really have a strong role here. And so from this case, things went really crazy. And people were all over contacting us about treatment, especially for pulmonary function. So pulmonary infections, specially those with CF. Okay, so she, you know, I often get asked, Oh, is it trade off a replacement because a lot of these lungs, especially cystic fibrosis, it's a really complicated community of many strains of Pseudomonas and other bacteria. And so the question is, often did you just kill the drug resistant ones? And then the drug sensitive ones grew up? Or were you causing some evolution happening inside the lungs? I think it's both actually. The original sputum had multiple phenotypes. Unsurprisingly, unsurprising. But by the end, it was basically a single isolate single strain. However, that's a replacement, strong suggestive of a replacement. However, in the lab, when I take these strains and expose them to phage, I can see a change in MSE to tobramycin. Also, so there's an improvement in sensitivities due to selection. So it's probably both there's a trade off happening as of evolution and lung. There's also a placement of by these less resistant strains are allowed to grow up with the niches opened up. So yeah, now we're way out there, she's got a really high ABV no hospitalizations, notes, so patients, um, so she's doing great. And she's, she's also been in the press quite a bit. She's, she's great, we still hang out there, and we're in touch pretty frequently. And so definitely read up on her case, if you're interested. There's a lot online. Her name is Paige Rogers, so you can watch it below documentaries about her. Um, and so so that really got people excited in the possibility of treating CF infections with with age. Um, so there are several other cases we treated. But after this owner infection that we treated, we basically set up the fH center. I thought I'd take a few minutes here and talk about the H Center. So we have a basic treatment algorithm where we you know, we have people coming in from all across the country or obviously, within Yale health system. With infection treated, we basically identified bacteria in Canada, phage. Syria, we select phage. In device treatment plants, we do an ultra personalized approach, we were very specific on what phages we use and for how long based on lab data, we're doing actual science, where we say, oh, use this page for four days, and then this one for three, and then this combination for another four days, and you have the highest likelihood of doing the bacteria reducing resistance and increasing sensitivity. Or maybe we're targeting virulence to all these things, we select the agent\n\n","    that we deploy the phage, right, so we have them all prepared in in a medically appropriate way. And they're pure enough to be used therapeutically. We treat the individuals and then we monitor changes, right? So a lot of these case reports, they're not doing science, but there's throwing the phage and they're saying, Oh, they got better. It was the page. We're actually monitoring changes. Okay. We have microbiome data for all these lung samples, we're looking at clinical changes in terms of lung function, we're looking at immune response, we're looking at evolution within the lung, we're looking at evolution within the wounds, we're looking at changes in terms of age sensitivity, we're looking at changes in antibiotic sensitivity, obviously, we're looking at changes in the production of these virulence factors during all this, so we really, really well what each page is doing inside the body. Okay. So, when we're selecting phage, we grew up the bacteria, right? And you turn it sensitivity, as I just said, in large Linux spectrums. We talked about this, maybe a few lectures back about determining a sensitivity on it, and then we select the appropriate range. So we have a big library phages at Yale, you know, in the thousands, when and we basically I isolate them constantly from all over the world and we select phages will make all of them but we select pages with relevant clinical and clinically meaning over sectors, right? You're trying to find phages that would make good therapy candidates because not all phages Well, even if phage kills bacteria really well, it might not be a good therapeutic candidate actually increased drug resistance, increase variance, we have to be very careful that we do this properly, or else we can cause disease towards a so we looking at this page for clinically clinically meaningful receptors, for example, antibody, efflux motility, virulence factor production, right? So, for example, let's just look at this page. We talked about a previously made targets antibiotic efflux, right? So you grew up bacteria. Supposing the phage, right, and then you've sequenced the bacteria to come out, and you quantify the number of mutate mutations that occur along the genome. You say, Ah, this guy has a bunch of mutations in efflux. Awesome, it did its job. We have another phage that targets tech for us, which is for motility. involved in motility and some virulence factor production. Actually, you do the same thing grew up the bacteria, explosive phage, select resistant mutants sequence those guys, you see a bunch of mutations in four pillars, exactly as you'd expect.\n\n","    The same thing for trying to reduce inflammation and maybe work synergistically with immune system, we might target the entity, right, so we do the same thing as the previous study. And these mutations are in LPs. Right now we have these three really good pages that we use therapeutically. So let's make a cocktail out of them. Right? Let's just take these three targets, three different virulence factors, pull them together, make a cocktail.\n\n","    The same thing is a cocktail growed up. If the resistant mutants, what do you see?\n\n","    Ah, it's not mutations in anabolic effects pills and MPs, as mutations in the capsule and mismatch repair is exactly what we didn't want. Resistant mutants in this case, are harder to kill by white blood cells, they have increased antibiotic resistance and increased chance of invading new tissues, this is gonna make the disease much worse using this cocktail, right. So what happens if we do it in series? This is my case for serial MonaVie therapy. You are the first page targets and resistant mutants that come out of all these mutations in flux, right? Take the strain, expose it to the next page. Boom, see the mutations in the pelisse. Right, hit it with the last page, we see all the changes in LPs surviving population now has decreased antibiotic resistance, decreased virulence and decreased ability to invade new niches and tissues and increased consumption by white blood cells. Right? So this can work synergistically with the immune system. Obviously, we're not always in a privileged position to to come up with a page cocktail and treat them see. Sorry, come on phages treat in series like this, for all cases, this works in chronic infections with high likelihood of recon ization or reinfection, right? If it's an acute and pen resistant infection that's very severe, you might not have the liberty to do this. And so just throw the cocktail at it, kill off a bunch of bacteria, control inflammation, come back with a new cocktail because your library should have hundreds of different foods, you can always find a new cocktail to use in series.\n\n","    So using this approach of serial monitor phage therapy, I'll talk about few other cases here. Right so this is a 16 year old girl with cystic fibrosis and has lung disease or pulmonary function. And she was experiencing it's pretty severe exacerbation. How does isn't Pseudomonas intervene with phage. Here again, pre and post junk sensitivities are here in the table on the left pod is the same as before and FPV one, so she started off with much lower lung function with some mild increase. But we did see a very rapid reduction of speed of bacteria density, two orders of magnitude reduced. And she returned to her baseline, C reactive protein and white blood cells after a week so suggesting that the phage intervention had helped with inflammation. Alright, so a couple more cases here so we treated a 26 year old woman with CF Same as before and resistance to monus. In her case, we were looking for a way that we can be open sensitivity to meropenem. So treated her here. You can see this plot is the green line is when based therapies and used in the pre therapy so I've had the privilege of getting sputum before treatment. quantified bacteria didn't see a change in speed and density. We asked phage and immediately saw a big reduction of Pseudomonas. In this case, it looks like nearly three orders of magnitude. And then the bacteria that grew out of that were sensitive to meropenem again, so she was able to get out of hospital. She's also been in the media quite a bit. My name's Ella. You can Google Ella Lhasa, and you'll see all about her story. But she actually stayed out of the hospital for quite a while with this benefit from page, all right case, blow this is an elderly gentleman with COPD and a massive lung abscess requiring surgical intervention. But the surgeons wouldn't touch the case because, you know, massive abscess and there was a big risk of opening them up the infection spread. So they had retweeted this guy with phage. And we have a pre age density of 10 to the six PS CFS per mil, we treated with the only antibiotic was sensitive to and actually, on the day we treated with phage. It was toward the end of that course of antibiotics and his bacterial load actually had gone up two orders of magnitude. We started with phage and immediately saw a big reduction in bacteria density, almost four orders of magnitude and re sensitization that America and he saw some improvement on imaging to the point where surgeons would once again consider the case for removal of abscess.\n\n","    Okay, just a couple more quick ones here with another non CF bronchiectasis this man was injured in a house fire with a lot of smoke 40 years ago, and then had a chronic lung lung infections ever since because a lung tissue was damaged. So his Pseudomonas was resistant to every chemical on ionic, even those in trials. And so he came to us about age, which he did this individual ice. So the first case here on the applaud this the first green section, we saw a big reduction of\n\n","    speed of density and bacteria, three orders of magnitude reduction.\n\n","    And then we treated him again a couple months later, and we saw another reduction of bacteria to the point of where it's below limit detection by the lab and this was a 16 year infection that is eradicated it's important to say that you see the two cultures here on the left. Um, that's the color of the bacteria before treatment and after treatment CCNA reduction of the production of Prasanna which is which is one of virulence factors talked about earlier in this lecture. So we actually made a prediction in the lab of what would happen, I created a visual saw what happened on the on the on the back end of that and actually matched our prediction. Okay, k seven down here is a 38 year old woman with CF. panners isn't Pseudomonas. Again, same stories before we treated with phage targeting pls, which was involved in Prasanna production, we saw an immediate reduction, two orders of magnitude reduction speed and density bacteria. And then we saw an improvement to separate floxin. So she could use that again, and a little bit of an improvement in FPV. One, you see the plates below here are actually agency sensitivity plates we took to some of our top phages. before, during and after phage therapy so the top is before things or screen during therapy is less screen and then after that, if you see three strains that we pulled that were completely devoid, so it's exactly as we would have predicted would have happened.\n\n","    Okay, so just some quick conclusions about this. This least with the with the work we're doing at Yale is that face can force clinically meaningful trade offs in vitro. Okay, lab essays can inform clinical decisions, especially regarding environment selection, we can work with clinicians to identify which pages will work best with certain antibiotics to optimize treatment, okay. Next bring phage treatment, they can be deployed safely and effectively seen zero severe adverse events, no bronchospasm nothing. And they can be deployed effectively to treat these infections, changes in bacterial community during phage therapy can be potentially predicted based on lab essays and CNN with inflammation with drug flux, we can make a prediction and it looks like it works to people. Okay. So, terms of outcome, clinically, clinically meaningful trade offs can be forced in vivo, right? So we can cause bacteria to be drug sensitive again, and cause them to stop producing some of these virulence factors. Okay, so changes in status, therefore, like in terms of improvement, maybe improve lung function, health can be attributed to a phage based intervention. However, in the absence of placebo controlled clinical trials, we can't definitively make that claim. We have a clinical trial that by the time this airs We started, we received permission from FDA to start, we're just finishing manufacturing today. That trial world isn't cystic fibrosis, we're going to work there. And we have two trials planned every year after that. And we're going to be working in different bacteria, different diseases. But until we get these clinical trials up and running, we can't make any claims. So this is where I would normally take questions. However, I obviously can't message me, but you can through email. It's been like every one of my lectures, or Instagram.

Um, so there are several other cases we treated. But after this owner infection that we treated, we basically set up the fH center. I thought I'd take a few minutes here and talk about the H Center. So we have a basic treatment algorithm where we you know, we have people coming in from all across the country or obviously, within Yale health system. With infection treated, we basically identified bacteria in Canada, phage. Syria, we select phage. In device treatment plants, we do an ultra personalized approach, we were very specific on what phages we use and for how long based on lab data, we're doing actual science, where we say, oh, use this page for four days, and then this one for three, and then this combination for another four days, and you have the highest likelihood of doing the bacteria reducing resistance and increasing sensitivity.

This least with the with the work we're doing at Yale is that face can force clinically meaningful trade offs in vitro. Okay, lab essays can inform clinical decisions, especially regarding environment selection, we can work with clinicians to identify which pages will work best with certain antibiotics to optimize treatment, okay. Next bring phage treatment, they can be deployed safely and effectively seen zero severe adverse events, no bronchospasm nothing. And they can be deployed effectively to treat these infections, changes in bacterial community during phage therapy can be potentially predicted based on lab essays and CNN with inflammation with drug flux, we can make a prediction and it looks like it works to people. Okay. So, terms of outcome, clinically, clinically meaningful trade offs can be forced in vivo, right? So we can cause bacteria to be drug sensitive again, and cause them to stop producing some of these virulence factors. Okay, so changes in status, therefore, like in terms of improvement, maybe improve lung function, health can be attributed to a phage based intervention. However, in the absence of placebo controlled clinical trials, we can't definitively make that claim. We have a clinical trial that by the time this airs We started, we received permission from FDA to start, we're just finishing manufacturing today. That trial world isn't cystic fibrosis, we're going to work there. And we have two trials planned every year after that. And we're going to be working in different bacteria, different diseases.

I am Dr. Shawna MacAllan. And I am a phage and clinical researcher here at the bogus University Hospital in Zurich. And I'm happy to be one of the lecturers in this online course series for phages. And today we're going to be talking about my favorite topic, which are clinical trials for phage therapy. And to start off with, I'd like to ask you a question. And that is, why would you take this medicine? So here you can see it's a bottle of aspirin, it's probably something that we've all come across and needed in our lifetimes and anti inflammatory and it's commonplace everywhere, across the world. So if you've answered yes to this question, I want to ask you, would you take this medicine, this is the Pio bacteriophage cocktail produced by elliana in Tbilisi, Georgia. So it is a registered medicine or product in Georgia, and it's sold as an over the counter medicine in the pharmacy. And when you look at these two different products, start to think about what makes you say, Okay, I'll take a pill of aspirin, and maybe might make you hesitate before you would take Pio bacteria phages. And that's really what we want to go through today is to look at why we do clinical trials, because this is what we need in order to bring a product to market.\n\n","    And in order to understand why we do them,\n\n","    we're going to have to briefly look at how they came about through history and where this idea of performing experiments on humans, rather than a test tube or on animals came about.\n\n","    Then we'll move on to when we do a\n\n","    clinical trial, what are the main different parts of a clinical study, before we actually move into the modern trials for phage therapy that have been performed to date. And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics. And in order to understand why we do clinical trials, it's really useful that we look at how drug development occurs. So a lot of what we think about for phage therapy phage experiments is really more this discovery phase where we have a great idea or a problem that needs solving. And we look at this problem or interesting idea through basic research, to in vitro tests in vivo tests. And we usually do this at the university or institutional level. But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.\n\n","    And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations. And depending on where you want to use that drug, you should can take into consideration what the local regulatory authorities are. And Tanzania, which is where we did our last in person lecture series was really impressive, because Tanzania is the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning and regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the w h o. And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market. So they control the access in of drugs into the market. But they also make sure that the drugs that are there are still functioning and safe. And they're still post surveillance studies that are performed even once a drug has a regulatory authorization. And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant. There is another few issues actually that have to do with introducing bias into the way that they structured this investigation is that there was no randomization. So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time. And lastly, but not all. One of the other issues is that this investigation was not blinded. So normally with a clinical trial, we really try not to know, either from the perspective of the patient, or if the treating physician what your patient is actually receiving if they're getting a placebo or the standard of care, or if they're getting the investigational product.\n\n","    And this is ultimately because we have a tendency to introduce biases, maybe you could treat a patient better than another or some way differently if you knew what you were giving them within the clinical trial. And this could really bias your results. Now, where clinical trials really developed was out of, you know, the devastation of World War Two. So this was, unfortunately, during this time, with the Nazi occupation, Nazi concentration camps, there was extreme inhumane experimentation performed on humans. And this really led to the development of ethical codes for how we have to work with patients, ethically, to ensure their dignity, and their well being and their freedom of choice. So this led to a variety of different legislations that have been adopted in various forums across the world, notably the Nuremberg Code, and the Helsinki declaration, that has really improved the way that we treat patients that are part of clinical trials. And overall, what this has led to is that when you perform a clinical trial, not only do you have to have the ethical committee or the regulatory authorities involved, you also to have to have an ethical Committee, which will look at the structure of your study, and possibly do some monitoring of the study to ensure that the patients are treated the way that they should be. And they're, they're ethically treated. And this also means that when we involve any type of human subjects in clinical research, where we make sure that we get informed consent, so that they are aware of what the study is, what they could happen to them, and that they have the right to withdrawal from the study at any point in time, for any reason. And there's also the idea that now patients as well, we have to go to great lengths to anonymize their data and protect their privacy.\n\n","    So really,\n\n","    as time goes on, we see a progression of clinical trials and how we did them. And one of the first randomized clinical trials, or the first actually comes from 1948. And in line with phage therapy, this also also has to do with bacterial infections. And so the first randomized clinical trial was actually investigating the use of structure myosin, to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and this was published in the British Medical Journal. And it was really, really remarkable because through this trial, they were able to show that when you treated with that strep demise, and only 7% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis die, whereas without step two minds and almost one third or 20% of the control patients, they they passed away. So again, that idea of introducing randomization is a way to reduce bias in your clinical trial and to have a greater trust in the data that you produce. So this concludes the first section and I will pick back up with you shortly where we look into the next sections of clinical trials for phage therapy.

And overall, what this has led to is that when you perform a clinical trial, not only do you have to have the ethical committee or the regulatory authorities involved, you also to have to have an ethical Committee, which will look at the structure of your study, and possibly do some monitoring of the study to ensure that the patients are treated the way that they should be. And they're, they're ethically treated. And this also means that when we involve any type of human subjects in clinical research, where we make sure that we get informed consent, so that they are aware of what the study is, what they could happen to them, and that they have the right to withdrawal from the study at any point in time, for any reason. And there's also the idea that now patients as well, we have to go to great lengths to anonymize their data and protect their privacy.\n\n","    So really,\n\n","    as time goes on, we see a progression of clinical trials and how we did them. And one of the first randomized clinical trials, or the first actually comes from 1948. And in line with phage therapy, this also also has to do with bacterial infections. And so the first randomized clinical trial was actually investigating the use of structure myosin, to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and this was published in the British Medical Journal. And it was really, really remarkable because through this trial, they were able to show that when you treated with that strep demise, and only 7% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis die, whereas without step two minds and almost one third or 20% of the control patients, they they passed away. So again, that idea of introducing randomization is a way to reduce bias in your clinical trial and to have a greater trust in the data that you produce. So this concludes the first section and I will pick back up with you shortly where we look into the next sections of clinical trials for phage therapy.

And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics. And in order to understand why we do clinical trials, it's really useful that we look at how drug development occurs. So a lot of what we think about for phage therapy phage experiments is really more this discovery phase where we have a great idea or a problem that needs solving. And we look at this problem or interesting idea through basic research, to in vitro tests in vivo tests. And we usually do this at the university or institutional level. But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.","properties":{"title":[["clinical trial, what are the main different parts of a clinical study, before we actually move into the modern trials for phage therapy that have been performed to date.

And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market.

And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size.

So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time.

And we are back for the second segment of this lecture on clinical trials for phage therapy. And we've just gotten done, speaking about the first parts of why we do clinical trials and also about some of the historical events that have really shaped clinical research today. Now, I'd like to move on and show you some of the main parts of a clinical study, because clinical research is quite different than what we're used to doing in a lab per se. So one of the things is that\n\n","    you have\n\n","    to first define your research question. And the idea is you have a research question in order to address a problem or missing piece of information and afield. So, particularly for phage therapy, our problem is really dealing with antibiotic resistance, or treatment failures for infectious disease. And then with the research question, we want to be able to test a possible solution. And in our case, this is bacteria phages. So an example of a research question would be something like can bacteriophages treat urinary tract infections, infections caused by multi drug resistant bacteria. And we'll see that even this is a little bit broad, and you should start with an idea like this, and then make it even more finer. finer is one of those great acronyms we use to try to guide and structure our research question. So find R stands for F meaning feasible, I meaning interesting, and being novel, ie ethical, we saw earlier that that's very important. And our that is relevant. So you can go through after you've come up with a research question to make sure it kind of ticks all of these boxes as of finer. So if we take the title of this\n\n","    publication, and\n\n","    we try to go through and pick out the Pico characteristics of the study, first we have so who is the population the key and key code, then who are we treating in this, this trial is urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. So that's the population that the study was targeting. Then in terms of the intra intervention, it's intra vesicle bacteriophages. Then for the control, it says in the title, it's placebo controlled, you'll have to read the study to find out what placebo was, then for the outcome, then its treatment. So they're really looking at the ability to treat urinary tract infections. And then if we look at the T, the type of study it is a double blind clinical trial. And I would say they could even gone further and indicated the phase of the study in this case, it would have been a phase two clinical trial.\n\n","    And when we look to design\n\n","    a study, first thing is we want to make sure that the trial is randomized, meaning that when a patient comes in, you don't know which of the treatment arms they'd be allocated to. So there's usually a whole system on how to randomize or a randomizing code. So it's not like the first 10 patients get the intervention. And then the next 10 patients get the placebo, or all of your patients starting with the first letter M get the intervention is usually a much more sophisticated and unpredictable system of deciding which patient gets which treatment. Another aspect for clinical trial design is that the study should be blinded, meaning that you should look at who actually knows who's getting what. So we could do a single blinded trial where only the patient doesn't know if what they're getting, you could do a double blinded trial where the physician, both the treating physician and the patient don't know what they're they're getting or administrating. Or depending on the design of the trial, you could also do a triple blinded saying, you know, maybe it's the person who prepares the medicines\n\n","    or\n\n","    something like that, you can either blind the study further. Then another important aspect is the control arm so you can't just you know, treat all of the patients with phages and then say okay, well this many, they their urinary tract infection got better, you have to be able to compare it to something. So in some instances, depending on the clinical indication, you would compare it to the standard of care that might be antibiotics or an answer my question We'll cream and other instances it would be a placebo. And that really depends on how the indication you're looking at is currently treated and what is ethical. And these three factors are these three things to design into the structure of a clinical trial are really important ways to reduce\n\n","    bias.\n\n","    So reduce sort of trying to structure your study in a way that will influence the final outcome. And then lastly, one other important aspect, super important aspect of a clinical trial is your expected effect. So the way that we judge if a clinical trial is a success or a failure is by looking at the primary outcome. So this is really your bottom line, what is the most important criteria that you are using or you're looking at in a clinical trial, and this is usually something when you're looking at advocacy is it's very patient centric, you know, if phages can make the bacteria go down, that's great. But if your patient still isn't feeling better, then ultimately, you wouldn't use phages in order to treat an infection. So usually, you want to have a primary outcome that is really centered around the patient. But then you can also design into the structure of a clinical trial, secondary outcomes. And this is usually where we add in aspects of microbiology, which is important for phages. Okay, an overall goal of a clinical trial is to obtain a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparing. So between, say, phages, and antibiotics or phages, and placebo, and the way that you judge that is through your primary outcome measure, and then P value of that difference. So the magical p value is really the statistical measure, then that will tell you if based off of all the the analysis you've done, if what you're looking at is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely that the outcome you are looking at is due to due to Chancellor. And my screen\n\n","    is pressing again,\n\n","    there we go.\n\n","    So another criteria, and when you're looking at a clinical trial to make sure that whatever it's saying is really sound is that studying the product safe, that there are no major biases that were introduced in the design of the study. So we saw randomization, blinding and comparatives, that the appropriate measures were taken, and super important for clinical trials are is that you used enough patience, that the intervention and the control were tested on enough people. So we'll see in a little bit that many of the clinical trials today for phage therapy involve a very few amount of patients. And when you don't have enough patients, it's difficult to know if what you're seeing is just due to chance, or if it's really something significant. And now the outcome is of a trial really affect what happens next. So if you can have a phase of a trial, say a phase one trial, and it shouldn't be safe, and then you would be allowed to progress into phase two studies. Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n","    And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem. I'm assuming if you're interested in phages, and phage therapy, then you're aware of this. But when we look back, even 3030 or 40 years ago, we would have a certain number of new antibacterial agents that were approved every year. So we're thinking, you know, back in the early 1980s, or 1980s, were up to 16 new drugs per year still being developed and approved for treating bacterial infections. Whereas now, you look down to the most recent data in this graph from 2008 to 2012. And that's maybe one or two. So that coupled with increasing costs for developing new medicines. Now they estimate that almost 400 and 60 million US dollars are required to go from, you know, when you have that bright idea to getting your authorizations, it's almost 500 million US dollars. And that is just an insane amount of money, especially when we're talking about infectious disease. You couple all of this, with the fact that time is really running out on the utility, we have antibiotics, and new alternatives are desperately needed. So if we look at how this relates a little bit to phage therapy, we've gone through the different studies. So we haven't talked before about phase zero. This is an observational study, which I would highly recommend, especially for phage based trials, because that's where you really look at your baseline demographics of a patient population. So in the incidence of urinary tract infections, for example, you would look to see which pathogens are causing the infection, look at the different strains and maybe their sensitivity to phages. Now, the phases one through four are really when you're in patience, and then this goes up in the probably the cost, but also the amount of patience, and then the different goals that you have for each of the phases. And really, the golden would you say the golden ticket is to get a successful phase three trial where you can obtain a marketing authorization. And now there's been a number shown here in these these small orange arrows of phase one safety studies that have been done with phage products. So if you look through the literature, there's quite a few of phase one trials and to date, there's been no phase one studies that have associated phage products with any type of safety concern. And then there's a few trials that now you can see in the slightly bolder orange arrows that are completed phase two trials. So this is really where they're looking for early signs of efficacy. And now that's what we're going to talk about in the next section after this short break is looking at the for phase two click clinical trials for phage therapy that have been completed today. Alright, see you in a little bit.

Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n","    And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem. I'm assuming if you're interested in phages, and phage therapy, then you're aware of this. But when we look back, even 3030 or 40 years ago, we would have a certain number of new antibacterial agents that were approved every year. So we're thinking, you know, back in the early 1980s, or 1980s, were up to 16 new drugs per year still being developed and approved for treating bacterial infections. Whereas now, you look down to the most recent data in this graph from 2008 to 2012. And that's maybe one or two. So that coupled with increasing costs for developing new medicines. Now they estimate that almost 400 and 60 million US dollars are required to go from, you know, when you have that bright idea to getting your authorizations, it's almost 500 million US dollars. And that is just an insane amount of money, especially when we're talking about infectious disease. You couple all of this, with the fact that time is really running out on the utility, we have antibiotics, and new alternatives are desperately needed. So if we look at how this relates a little bit to phage therapy, we've gone through the different studies. So we haven't talked before about phase zero. This is an observational study, which I would highly recommend, especially for phage based trials, because that's where you really look at your baseline demographics of a patient population. So in the incidence of urinary tract infections, for example, you would look to see which pathogens are causing the infection, look at the different strains and maybe their sensitivity to phages. Now, the phases one through four are really when you're in patience, and then this goes up in the probably the cost, but also the amount of patience, and then the different goals that you have for each of the phases. And really, the golden would you say the golden ticket is to get a successful phase three trial where you can obtain a marketing authorization. And now there's been a number shown here in these these small orange arrows of phase one safety studies that have been done with phage products. So if you look through the literature, there's quite a few of phase one trials and to date, there's been no phase one studies that have associated phage products with any type of safety concern. And then there's a few trials that now you can see in the slightly bolder orange arrows that are completed phase two trials. So this is really where they're looking for early signs of efficacy. And now that's what we're going to talk about in the next section after this short break is looking at the for phase two click clinical trials for phage therapy that have been completed today. Alright, see you in a little bit. Bye.\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["62bf34a8-1e9e-4f94-8fca-760edbb78048","3fd1db50-5833-45a7-9919-5aea73ef39a5","cddcc11f-b588-40cf-91e5-7c164f2c3575","8cacdd96-6bfa-4243-b93e-442b6a125f4c","85ee50d2-e627-4e48-b834-9283dc2c20f6","71020329-5679-4da0-b16f-2f633e9dd2f0","efadea1a-0e61-4194-a39c-b722abfef96a","c3a15749-f41f-41ff-9159-6daa1d99c620","c24ec443-a47f-4e93-903d-8b9fa1ea6232","5c8ec5a2-6ef3-48a4-8a4f-d21f783a6114","9435da35-f087-4fe5-9766-23c1644e7122","21c9636e-f53e-4307-92fc-6df985175b92","e679a39d-90c9-4193-baaf-3602d458b390","ddce5156-1204-419b-82ee-4f2d3120d901","a0d38247-cb36-4528-aee4-d63e3c5537e2","709b5657-06c8-49ab-b49a-cda5bd0057d8","4c0c7b27-00b2-48e7-8adf-ba42c40aa822","68fb6f2f-3a5d-4bf3-8dc8-a42712339d7b"],"content":[{"id":"62bf34a8-1e9e-4f94-8fca-760edbb78048","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 0:00","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 0:00"]]},"parent_id":"7d74e56d-2911-4633-b609-0b885720e11e","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 0:00\n\n"]},{"id":"3fd1db50-5833-45a7-9919-5aea73ef39a5","type":"text","value":"Hi, everyone.","properties":{"title":[["Hi, everyone."]]},"parent_id":"7d74e56d-2911-4633-b609-0b885720e11e","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Hi, everyone.\n\n"]},{"id":"cddcc11f-b588-40cf-91e5-7c164f2c3575","type":"text","value":"I'm Dr.","properties":{"title":[["I'm Dr."]]},"parent_id":"7d74e56d-2911-4633-b609-0b885720e11e","parent_table":"block","markdown":["I'm Dr.\n\n"]},{"id":"8cacdd96-6bfa-4243-b93e-442b6a125f4c","type":"text","value":"Shawna McKellen.

Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n"]},{"id":"68fb6f2f-3a5d-4bf3-8dc8-a42712339d7b","type":"text","value":"And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures. Bye\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["ad44d67b-f87a-437d-bf59-c7de735ac9fc","c56cadd1-0511-4990-89b4-22d80e53c174","27dd6897-7197-4c8e-afb0-9b6175f5c004","c3d2454b-0c12-4cfc-b2b1-302aac089b1c","2badb935-1e2a-4850-9a23-337833fc5542","9b5c24fb-6ea5-492c-9a69-96f7d133ebda","93375d49-2d1b-4712-8d35-f70993f50085","b6a1340d-2790-47c0-989e-02b605175583","8e4b871f-44ea-4da3-ae69-21c97dc29ca0","530f513b-9d42-4100-a3d5-fa79a6359a52","e0b862b8-82ae-4980-9164-d5e8100ea1fa","e16b84a6-c108-454e-8e5c-8959c9627d32","b0ac5246-e81a-4fb4-9bb9-73102db1c77a","ad4a2a4f-5837-463c-ba1a-3a0bf23f5566","97414f59-e2d9-4533-b4b6-ea12685d1cc1","362e210a-a46a-47fd-a543-d9caeeaff788","0fbb91e6-43ca-4ceb-a7b7-6f894bbc5284","30530336-79c1-4165-8ee4-96e011e11220","4c018842-b6c3-49ff-bd2e-1b4180385056","57da1d5c-d431-4f4a-95a8-4c88a95ac70e","81e08935-c759-4498-b1de-9defdc6d679b","77407d78-60a3-4336-9ea8-666bde91bc45","937e1724-70f7-43a2-bbe8-2d1af556ce2c","93d103d8-a94a-470e-b6bf-7e54ae07796a","36812216-6e9d-4249-8017-16c81ae10851","ccb918b0-ddcf-4be9-85d6-f13e9b480723","9d4e36b4-d094-42af-bba0-494abee48b2a","f1a3842d-636f-4606-baea-95438704abc7","7cb73522-def7-4e2f-a49a-47a74b6acbdf","e2b7d2cd-692e-403f-8926-08887931acef","3f03702f-a3f3-4f97-a4fc-30860d92e55a","d798d448-48de-40f0-b27c-56692e69c2e4","cd6c7293-0826-42b7-81e8-0a15816e9f6d","8fae216b-d431-4e76-9d63-435ed16cbe3d","be9aeaf4-0958-49d7-9409-9c6fbd607b04","0c8a4bf1-078d-4ae2-8abc-cddabd19e6b5","1a00d7f7-8399-4832-bf70-246cd94c931c","e49c4ce5-26e8-497c-99b2-7fb5ecce1cb9","f9e2191c-aeeb-44ea-822e-4777dad5aa91","37ccd2fc-d77d-4e3f-8675-b10f85a10a8a","ac9eb5b6-3cc1-469c-8466-3c21f6ee2475","178ee923-e5b7-4d7d-a2c4-347bdaabbcea","84ad5f07-5516-469b-a630-750dd5a70207","e619c631-15d6-4afd-bd2b-b049c84ac9e7","b009b4e3-96f7-42c4-882e-c7037eb82a51","ec174a90-80c5-4c14-880c-42d9ec2af6d2","da737d43-28c4-4984-bc6c-ed96265a498c","634023e3-0ea7-404e-8602-0591b65abb05","8f0482cf-45bd-48a4-a568-11c074df069e","303fd9d8-887a-4826-8c91-983a9f7772f4","f70c3ad5-8c6c-4cf5-8f7f-244c32be5500","d20f2176-3be9-4a83-adfc-b6b561015a0e","268670f8-9c2e-447b-9cf0-0b8bed22ad94","57756f19-8737-4c22-906a-25ec3b85a95e","5fa48b42-a3bd-4e93-a201-c01a1aeee19d","6f46eb00-a1b0-4ff1-b218-4aa15c5e05ab","6045d0aa-268c-4c95-9c18-f95c2c069349","2026fd64-1a2d-4664-83ca-9fd49f984679","2ab7d057-b4a3-44c6-8891-cb43936e9d7a","b3981bec-8ab4-497c-8328-9783a1efdfad","9530b143-013d-4e5b-9444-70a32d0ca737","a4f10f25-adb2-4e7f-8e38-9e8472d998f2","78438a91-a87b-4031-bf0c-fcdc9f1764df","1f4d9875-de3c-4eaa-aec1-493e3ac66691","97544024-17d2-4e16-bb21-1a79479837b1","4b2e140a-40cd-47c0-871f-66296ea183ca","40da93ae-a200-4d8e-a7a6-b5265bf5817b","eec606c6-9acd-450c-b3b0-9791bef41d75","4eaed270-e34e-4ff3-a184-b97f34003f81","c568a5f6-370b-4710-ac0d-2fc02b3f3a17","f0e02cbe-b48d-4205-af53-1ab7f8928fd1","4c6f38f3-a14b-474f-8f1c-2e60d8a52503"],"content":[{"id":"ad44d67b-f87a-437d-bf59-c7de735ac9fc","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 0:00","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 0:00"]]},"parent_id":"967082ba-8a3a-4eb8-ae6f-45d8de4d2bb4","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 0:00\n\n"]},{"id":"c56cadd1-0511-4990-89b4-22d80e53c174","type":"text","value":"Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen.

\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:01\n\n","    Hello everyone, this is dr. john x nalli from the University of Leicester. The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here. The liquid I'm going to transfer is an SM buffer in a falcon tube I have got my P 1000 tips. Remember these will go with the p 1000 p pets. Now, I intend to transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer into the end of chip. So I'm going to take my P 1000 compact\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:31\n\n","    and I just the controller 250.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:35\n\n","    Remember I told you that the numbers on the controller is one digit short. So the 50 is 500 microliters of volume of whatever liquid I'm going to transfer.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:59\n\n","    I'm now going to press the plunger\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:03\n\n","    to the first stop\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:10\n\n","    and push the tip of the micropipette into one of the pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:21\n\n","    While the plunger is still down,\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:27\n\n","    I'm going to insert the tip\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:31\n\n","    just touching the SM buffer remember not to go beyond the pipette tip into whatever bottle or two that you are taking the material from. Once I release the plunger I have already aspirated the platform but microliters and by pressing back the plunger to the first stop, I will not release the material into the eppendorf tube. I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957.

The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here. The liquid I'm going to transfer is an SM buffer in a falcon tube I have got my P 1000 tips. Remember these will go with the p 1000 p pets. Now, I intend to transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer into the end of chip. So I'm going to take my P 1000 compact\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:31\n\n","    and I just the controller 250.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:35\n\n","    Remember I told you that the numbers on the controller is one digit short. So the 50 is 500 microliters of volume of whatever liquid I'm going to transfer.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:59\n\n","    I'm now going to press the plunger\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:03\n\n","    to the first stop\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:10\n\n","    and push the tip of the micropipette into one of the pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:21\n\n","    While the plunger is still down,\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:27\n\n","    I'm going to insert the tip\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:31\n\n","    just touching the SM buffer remember not to go beyond the pipette tip into whatever bottle or two that you are taking the material from. Once I release the plunger I have already aspirated the platform but microliters and by pressing back the plunger to the first stop, I will not release the material into the eppendorf tube. I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957. And I've also clearly demonstrated to you how you can use the micropipette to transport liquids from one container to the other. I hope this video is useful for you and help you in your microbiology research.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame. So this is me now just opening a pipette tip on the burner. And now I'm going to pour a medium into the plate. So I've got my medium which is hot and I'm now going to pour it into the plate I need to keep the plates as close to the fire as possible and the bottle as well. Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing. So whatever has descended on the tip of the bottle need to be sterilized. Now I'm going to show you how I'm going to strip out bacteria. This is a Staphylococcus aureus culture on a blue plate. And I'm going to transfer that to a stereo plate that I've just prepared. Now this plate is all set. So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200. And then you can use that micropipette on the P 200. Tip. Good.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:31\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you my diluent which is going to be assemble for you can use water in this case for your crystal violet, because what we'll be diluting is 1% crystal violates and this will just help to show the graduation or the reduction of the dilution as we go down the tubes. So I'm just opening the tube now. And I am working within a class to safety cabinet. That's why I don't have a flame with me. Now I've taken my P 1000, which is such to 900 microliters capacity. Now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tip. Now I'm going to take one tip. And I'm going to transfer. As I've shown you in my initial video, you have to press the plunger to the first stop. And now I'm going to add the quote. Now 900 microliters of my di D went into the tubes, I have to add this same quantity to all the tubes 900 microliters, of diluent. And as I've said, I'm using SM buffer. But if you do not want to waste your material, you can equally use water to dilute your crystal violet. But if you're diluting your phage, you will need to use assemble for and as you can see, I'm only allowing just the end of the tip to go into the tube do not exceed that because the only sterile part of the pipette is actually the tip. So now I'm going to put the P 1000. aside and close the eppendorf tubes containing my diluent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 7:10\n\n","    All of these contain my daily but not I'm going to pick the crystal violet that I hope to dilute and is going to be 10 for dilution, because each tube is daily diluted a tenfold to the next two. So this is the P 200 tips, which will go with my P 100. I'm going to pick a to a tip Sorry, I'm going to press it to the first plunger. Do not exceed that, or else you're going to take excess amount. So I'm now open my crystal violet. And I'm going to add that to the first tube which is the minus one tube. I'm going to resuspend that couple of time. And I'm going to throw away that pipette tip. After discarding, I will take a fresh tip and transfer material from the minus one\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 8:26\n\n","    tube\n\n","    Janet Nale 8:34\n\n","    into the minus two tube. And I'm going to resuspend that by putting up and down a couple of times to resuspend. And to equally distribute the crystal violet. I've discarded the initial tip and picked a fresh one. Now I'm going to go in to the minus two tube and take 100 microliters in there and that will be transferred into minus three tube. Now discard it again and pay the fresh tip and not open the minus three and that is how I'm going to do until the crystal violet is diluted tenfold across the tubes. So all you're doing is just gradually diluting your initial stock sample reducing the numbers with the amount by a tenfold Just remember to keep changing the tip as you dilute.\n\n","    Janet Nale 9:58\n\n","    That is the minor six We are graduating to minus seven MCs. Good to take that. And now we have added to the minus eight, you may choose to eliminate 100 microliters from the minus minus eight to ensure you've got equal amount. But for this case, this is unnecessary. So I'm just showing you the graduation of the color of the crystal violet within the tube. And as you can see, by the time we get to minus eight, it is basically\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 10:42\n\n","    reduced\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:44\n\n","    drastically to a clear liquid. So for us to actually see this in a visual way, I've now put 96 well plate culture played out. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters of the diluted crystal violet into the well. So I'm just changing the volume setting till I get 200 microliters. So this is p 200 p pet. So it's set. So to 200. So these are my tips, the p p 200. Tips, which will match my P 200. Micro micro pipette. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters to each of the wells. So I'm going to press again the plunger to the first stop. So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n"],"children":["cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","8dd96423-b5ca-4433-bb14-c635df7e0704"],"content":[{"id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"e6b5c475-067b-4ebd-8362-5c8a0a07b510","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:06\n\n","    Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

So all you're doing is just gradually diluting your initial stock sample reducing the numbers with the amount by a tenfold Just remember to keep changing the tip as you dilute.\n\n","    Janet Nale 9:58\n\n","    That is the minor six We are graduating to minus seven MCs. Good to take that. And now we have added to the minus eight, you may choose to eliminate 100 microliters from the minus minus eight to ensure you've got equal amount. But for this case, this is unnecessary. So I'm just showing you the graduation of the color of the crystal violet within the tube. And as you can see, by the time we get to minus eight, it is basically\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 10:42\n\n","    reduced\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:44\n\n","    drastically to a clear liquid. So for us to actually see this in a visual way, I've now put 96 well plate culture played out. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters of the diluted crystal violet into the well. So I'm just changing the volume setting till I get 200 microliters. So this is p 200 p pet. So it's set. So to 200. So these are my tips, the p p 200. Tips, which will match my P 200. Micro micro pipette. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters to each of the wells. So I'm going to press again the plunger to the first stop. So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","2c9f9bce-f342-4c2b-8bfc-7a8fafce4544","5c128188-4fab-4349-b761-089a6b8b314a","3ef5090e-9b62-4960-b40e-7d6b1d099a08","ff484326-0c5c-40cf-987d-80a912a7adaf","6ec64614-6d86-4e3e-8f1b-a653ccdfdb63","49eb0cbf-f40c-4062-ba65-fc4cd25d6d0c","895dc0e1-09ac-464d-81ac-6cc34dcf0817","9a52503d-ed10-4ee8-b18e-ff13a094924b","5f1704f0-df56-414d-b786-8a2b6dd1ad4e","3791ee6e-06ee-4311-b371-ab7bb8ece87f","1f971023-b531-41f3-8a9d-bc0e09f84c94","c0f2b33b-f907-4ad9-a9c7-c69aa34accbf","4002a578-0879-4631-bc49-d17fc4f1d4f8","92badb7c-6d05-4919-a75e-0642123a16f9","7cc5d10b-c74e-4e41-b6c8-3d7e875dad12","5bd83d34-7771-4041-b8e9-1d51ed98f488"],"content":[{"id":"24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 0:06","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 0:06"]]},"parent_id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 0:06\n\n"]},{"id":"852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","type":"text","value":"Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

In this video, we are going to apply our knowledge on serial dilution to be able to enumerate a phage. So if you haven't seen my previous video on how I use crystal violet, diluting it to decreasing concentration, please, I will really recommend that you have a look at that video because that will greatly help in the understanding of the serial dilution that we are going to conduct now on the phage. So I'm going to dilute this page because I need to enumerate the number of phage, or the concentration of phage within this feature lysate that I have got. So I have got a universal truth here containing some phage. So now I'm going to I have already added SM buffer into the tube. And because I'm going to do my dilution in one meal that is 1000 microliters, I have added 900 microliters of the SM buffer into each of the tubes shown in the video. So I've labeled that minus one to minus eight. And I've picked my P 1000 micropipette. And I've set it to 100 microliters. And now I'm going to use my P 200. Tips, which will fit my P 100. micropipette. I'm going to take one of each and transfer 100 microliters. So if you refer back to my video, the crystal violet, I have to use the same method to dilute the crystal violet. And this is a 10 fold serial dilution. So 100 microliters of the phage lysate is going to be transferred to my first tube containing my 900 microliters of the diamond which is SM buffer and I'm mixing it by pipetting up and down just a couple of times using the plunger. I'm going to throw that tip away. And I'm going to take a fresh tip you have to change the tip because you're moving for from a higher concentration to a lower concentration or in your diner. And so I've just aspirated 100 microliters of the minus one diluted sample, and I've added it to the minus two tube, mix it throw away the tape, I'm not taking a fresh tip, and going in to the minus two tube aspirating 100 microliters and then adding that to the minus three tube. And I'm just mixed it might be putting up and down, threw away that pipette tip and then taking the minus three removing hundred microliters into minus four. So this is just diluting my phage from a very high concentration to low concentration in a systematic way using 10 fold dilution methods. And it is reducing my phage to a certain amount that I will be able to count. Now I'm adding from the minus five to minus six. throwing away the pet got fresh pet back to minus six. Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight. So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections.

Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight. So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections.

And today part as part of your lab video series, which you've largely heard from Dr. Janet nalli. Today, I'll be talking to you about sterilizing media. So for many of you, this is probably something that you're quite used to doing. Maybe if you're new edit, there's always some tix tips and tricks to pick up on. So I will go over some of the basic things about how to prepare media, how to mix it well before sterilizing, then how to autoclave it, as well as some common practices for storage. And then very importantly, to always look for contaminations before starting your experiments. So first of all, we talked about preparing media. This is an example of how to make lb growth media. So this is Luria bertani. broth says very commonly used, especially for things like E. coli. So here you've got your recipe, with the different chemicals that you need, shown down here with the different pictures, and then the amount that you need for making a specific volume. So either one leader, as shown here, or sometimes we'll add in if we have a common volume to already pre do the calculation, as shown here for eight liters. So lb broth liquid is usually used to drum in order to make overnight cultures have your bacteria, or with phages, sometimes to do turbidity reduction assays. So you've got your recipe, your chemicals, make sure you've got very clean glassware, as well as a scale to weigh the different chemicals. Now, if we wanted to make another type of media we can build off of this recipe. And the example here I'm showing is how to make lb agar plates. So the petri dishes that you would use in a lot of the types of experiments we would be doing. And so here you use lb IR, to plate bacteria to do viable bacterial enumeration, as well as doing phage specific experiments such as phage, titration, and spot assays. So here, the recipe is the same as before, except for the addition of 15 grams per liter of agere. And now, there's another common media that we use in phage research that I haven't seen in many other experiments. This is lb soft agere or lb sloppy agere. So if you hear soft or sloppy agere, this refers to a type of agbar, that is prepared almost the same well, exactly the same way, except for you add a lower amount of agere into the media, so it's not quite as solid. And we use this when we're trying to mix the phage and bacteria and see their interaction. So we use these for either the spot essays, or for doing phage titrations and double layers. And so as you can see here, instead of 15 grams per liter. And this recipe in our lab, we add four grams per liter for 0.4%. In the final bottle that you'll be using some labs use a slightly higher percentage before I was using 0.7%. So it's just worth looking at see the recipe that you should be following for your experiments. And now here, you can see that when you first start off with, you've got your scale and then whatever you're using to weigh the different chemicals. And you have to make sure that you actually break your scale on zero before weighing. So this is just for the first chemical.\n\n","    And then you add it. So here we've got 10 grams of tryptone. Add that to your bottle, move on to yeast extract, then NaCl and then finally agere. And what's important is that you use one of these recipients and don't add your chemicals directly into the bottle in case that you add too much. And it's very difficult to remove from a mixed solution like that. So weigh them all individually, put them into your bottles. And then when you're ready, it's time to mix. So the first thing is to add an amount of milli q water to a total to the total volume that you're looking for. For example, here you have got one liter so this could be milli q or sterilized double distilled water, something that's quite clean that you'll be using in your final preparation. And then next you have to stir or shake to mixed well. And in order to do that, here you can see the photo that when you prepare the media and you let it sit for some time, it can really sediment on the bottom like this. So you've got really aqueous phase and then all of the agora nutrients kind of collect on the bottom. And what we do to solve that problem is we would add a magnetic stir so you can just drop a little magnetic stir in there, and then put that onto a plate. Here I've got a little video showing how that mixes the media really well. And then once you're done with that, you can see that it really makes everything quite turbid and homogeneous. And if you don't have magnetic stirs, or a stirring plate, that's okay, just make sure bottles closed really well give it a good shake, a lot of times, I'll hit it against my hip, or something to make sure that it really shakes well. And what you're trying to do here is to avoid having like little clumps, or things like that of the media, within the solution itself. Because if you have clumps, when you go to autoclave it, it won't reach or penetrate very deeply in there, to try to mix it as much as you can to remove the clumps. Now, when you're autoclaving, the media, you put it into the autoclave, and what's very important is to label your bottles. So normally, what I'll do is I'll put whatever it is that I've been making, whatever the date is, and my initials. And why it's important for whatever it's, whatever it is, is normally you know, you're putting it into the autoclave, it doesn't mean you're always the person to get it out. So it's important and a good idea to label what it is that you're autoclaving. Now, the second other thing to keep in mind is that you should be using autoclave tape. So this is this nice tape that is white before you put it into the autoclave. And after a certain amount of time, ahead of temperature and pressure, the tape will change color. And I'll show you an example of that in a minute. So another thing is to make sure that you keep the lid open slightly. This is just because when it's getting hot, you need that pressure to be able to remove or else you'll explode your bottle, this would not be very good. So I just tend to open it slightly so that you know if there's steam, it could get out. And then lastly, you would put your your media that you've prepared into the autoclave. And then each autoclave is a little bit different. So this way, you really have to make sure make sure you ask whoever is there who has used the machine before how to use it correctly and safely. Now here you can see the example of when you've got not autoclave versus autoclaved. So this is the way that we know that the media has been properly sterilized. And then after once the autoclave is over, we keep in mind that the bottles and the liquids will be extremely hot. So make sure that you've got gloves or some type of protective wear in order to remove the bottles or just wait for a certain amount of time until it's cooled down a little bit. So media without agbar could then just be taken out and left at room temperature. But if you're making something such as LBI Gar or soft or sloppy, either, you don't want to put that oops, and that's a typo that should not be five that should be 50 to 60 degrees Celsius is gonna make a very big difference. So please take note of that. So if you're making anything with argon, you should let it equilibrate at a temperature of 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. Now this is usually done in either an incubator set at that temperature or in a water bath. And this is because when it comes out of the autoclave, it's super, super hot. And you need to let the temperature cool down to a working temperature where the Aguilar is still in its liquid phase, but that won't burn through your plates or your tubes or kill your bacteria. So another thing to keep in mind is make sure you know we opened it slightly before we put it into the autoclave. Now if this is the right time to make sure that you close the bottles very tightly afterwards\n\n","    to there as a reminder, again to check your labor your lines for the autoclave. And, yes, last reminder, eco delivery at the temperature desired before using and very, very important. Before you would use any of the media you've made containing anger, you know, we shake shook it really well before we put it into the autoclave, but when you take it out, look at it. Again, you'll probably have this sort of sedimentation onto the bottom. So when you take anything with ag or before making plates or doing with anything with the soft dagger, make sure you give it a good shake. Sometimes you'll see the Eiger sort of swirl around and then redistribute in the bottle. Because what happens is if you don't do that, and you take maybe say from this top layer, it doesn't contain as much anger from the bottom and you'll have inconsistent percentages a bag or or even the anger won't solidify. So give it a good shake before using it. Like that. All right, so just a quick word about storing media. The first thing you should ask yourself is does it have Aguilar in it or not? So if not like the lb broth we talked about earlier you Just take it out and leave it at room temperature. Now, if it does contain IR, if you want to use it right away, then you should put it into this incubator or water bath at 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. And this way, it'll cool it down to a working temperature. And if you want to keep it for using later, you can leave it at room temperature at which point it will solidify. But then keep in mind, you have to have some way to remelt it if you want to use it in the future. So maybe a microwave or something, I don't really like to do this, it's kind of a pain. But if that's the way you do things in the lab or the way you have to because you make in a different location, that's okay, just keep in mind, you're going to need to have some way to melt it again, before you could use it in any experiments. And another quick word about using a water bath is that Be careful if you leave something in a water bath too long because contaminations can occur. I've seen this a lot because the water itself can get quite dirty. And then if there's a little drop that gets in, it can infect or contaminate your media. So that brings us on to the last topic, which is contaminations. So what you can see here is that a mold somehow got into the plate, and now has contaminated this this was previously used for bacterial culture. Now this can happen on plates, for example that you've just stored. So say you poured our plates, and you leave them on your bench to cool down and use them the next day. If there's any type of small spores in the air. Or if you weren't using a Bunsen burner or something like that, it's possible that your plates could get a mold like growth on them. And really, what's important is always just to look and check your material before you're using it. So look for mold, or if you're looking at the the liquid media itself, pick up the bottle and swirl it around. And if you see then afterwards, if there's a sort of spiral or like a little hurricane of something inside your media, it's probably because it's contaminated. And you definitely shouldn't use it for your experiments. So again, be careful if you're using a water bath, try not to use a water bath for increased periods of time, like I'll use it for the experiment I'm doing and then I shut it off. So my tubes are in the water only for a few hours. But if you're using it to store your your media really have to make sure that the water itself as well as clean, or you're running an increased risk of contamination. And lastly, if you're pouring our plates, try to store them at four degrees after they've solidified. And until you're ready to use them. And this will also decrease your risk of contamination. So in conclusion, always, always ask about local procedures that they're in place for making media. This can be different in different labs, the best thing to do is follow the protocol and the lab where you're at. Always ask questions and be careful when you're using an autoclave. And then secondly, that's it, use your autoclave, be safe, most important. And then make sure that you will shake your media before you pour plates or doing any type of experiments to really mix that Eiger really well. And then lastly, check for contaminations. So I hope that was helpful. And just a quick reminder for some on how to use and sterilize media properly. Make sure that you're starting off your experiments with something sterile, and that the results you obtain are what you want to see and not because you're married, your media wasn't sterilized property. So thank you and good luck with your experiments.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 13:41\n\n","    Bye\n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["7df93a5a-d397-47bd-9945-c68b72623f9a"],"content":[{"id":"7df93a5a-d397-47bd-9945-c68b72623f9a","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"05fa5cea-41a6-467c-9ccc-deec0984ffd8","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n","    Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen at the bogus University Hospital here in Zurich, Switzerland. And today part as part of your lab video series, which you've largely heard from Dr. Janet nalli. Today, I'll be talking to you about sterilizing media. So for many of you, this is probably something that you're quite used to doing. Maybe if you're new edit, there's always some tix tips and tricks to pick up on. So I will go over some of the basic things about how to prepare media, how to mix it well before sterilizing, then how to autoclave it, as well as some common practices for storage.

In the final bottle that you'll be using some labs use a slightly higher percentage before I was using 0.7%. So it's just worth looking at see the recipe that you should be following for your experiments. And now here, you can see that when you first start off with, you've got your scale and then whatever you're using to weigh the different chemicals. And you have to make sure that you actually break your scale on zero before weighing. So this is just for the first chemical."]]},"parent_id":"7df93a5a-d397-47bd-9945-c68b72623f9a","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen at the bogus University Hospital here in Zurich, Switzerland. And today part as part of your lab video series, which you've largely heard from Dr. Janet nalli. Today, I'll be talking to you about sterilizing media. So for many of you, this is probably something that you're quite used to doing. Maybe if you're new edit, there's always some tix tips and tricks to pick up on. So I will go over some of the basic things about how to prepare media, how to mix it well before sterilizing, then how to autoclave it, as well as some common practices for storage. And then very importantly, to always look for contaminations before starting your experiments. So first of all, we talked about preparing media. This is an example of how to make lb growth media. So this is Luria bertani. broth says very commonly used, especially for things like E. coli. So here you've got your recipe, with the different chemicals that you need, shown down here with the different pictures, and then the amount that you need for making a specific volume. So either one leader, as shown here, or sometimes we'll add in if we have a common volume to already pre do the calculation, as shown here for eight liters. So lb broth liquid is usually used to drum in order to make overnight cultures have your bacteria, or with phages, sometimes to do turbidity reduction assays. So you've got your recipe, your chemicals, make sure you've got very clean glassware, as well as a scale to weigh the different chemicals. Now, if we wanted to make another type of media we can build off of this recipe. And the example here I'm showing is how to make lb agar plates. So the petri dishes that you would use in a lot of the types of experiments we would be doing. And so here you use lb IR, to plate bacteria to do viable bacterial enumeration, as well as doing phage specific experiments such as phage, titration, and spot assays. So here, the recipe is the same as before, except for the addition of 15 grams per liter of agere. And now, there's another common media that we use in phage research that I haven't seen in many other experiments. This is lb soft agere or lb sloppy agere. So if you hear soft or sloppy agere, this refers to a type of agbar, that is prepared almost the same well, exactly the same way, except for you add a lower amount of agere into the media, so it's not quite as solid. And we use this when we're trying to mix the phage and bacteria and see their interaction. So we use these for either the spot essays, or for doing phage titrations and double layers. And so as you can see here, instead of 15 grams per liter. And this recipe in our lab, we add four grams per liter for 0.4%. In the final bottle that you'll be using some labs use a slightly higher percentage before I was using 0.7%. So it's just worth looking at see the recipe that you should be following for your experiments. And now here, you can see that when you first start off with, you've got your scale and then whatever you're using to weigh the different chemicals. And you have to make sure that you actually break your scale on zero before weighing. So this is just for the first chemical.\n\n"]},{"id":"e5f95b6c-7de4-4445-b993-f1e4edb4bc8b","type":"text","value":"And then you add it. So here we've got 10 grams of tryptone. Add that to your bottle, move on to yeast extract, then NaCl and then finally agere. And what's important is that you use one of these recipients and don't add your chemicals directly into the bottle in case that you add too much. And it's very difficult to remove from a mixed solution like that. So weigh them all individually, put them into your bottles. And then when you're ready, it's time to mix. So the first thing is to add an amount of milli q water to a total to the total volume that you're looking for. For example, here you have got one liter so this could be milli q or sterilized double distilled water, something that's quite clean that you'll be using in your final preparation. And then next you have to stir or shake to mixed well. And in order to do that, here you can see the photo that when you prepare the media and you let it sit for some time, it can really sediment on the bottom like this. So you've got really aqueous phase and then all of the agora nutrients kind of collect on the bottom. And what we do to solve that problem is we would add a magnetic stir so you can just drop a little magnetic stir in there, and then put that onto a plate. Here I've got a little video showing how that mixes the media really well. And then once you're done with that, you can see that it really makes everything quite turbid and homogeneous. And if you don't have magnetic stirs, or a stirring plate, that's okay, just make sure bottles closed really well give it a good shake, a lot of times, I'll hit it against my hip, or something to make sure that it really shakes well. And what you're trying to do here is to avoid having like little clumps, or things like that of the media, within the solution itself. Because if you have clumps, when you go to autoclave it, it won't reach or penetrate very deeply in there, to try to mix it as much as you can to remove the clumps. Now, when you're autoclaving, the media, you put it into the autoclave, and what's very important is to label your bottles. So normally, what I'll do is I'll put whatever it is that I've been making, whatever the date is, and my initials. And why it's important for whatever it's, whatever it is, is normally you know, you're putting it into the autoclave, it doesn't mean you're always the person to get it out. So it's important and a good idea to label what it is that you're autoclaving. Now, the second other thing to keep in mind is that you should be using autoclave tape. So this is this nice tape that is white before you put it into the autoclave. And after a certain amount of time, ahead of temperature and pressure, the tape will change color. And I'll show you an example of that in a minute. So another thing is to make sure that you keep the lid open slightly. This is just because when it's getting hot, you need that pressure to be able to remove or else you'll explode your bottle, this would not be very good. So I just tend to open it slightly so that you know if there's steam, it could get out. And then lastly, you would put your your media that you've prepared into the autoclave. And then each autoclave is a little bit different. So this way, you really have to make sure make sure you ask whoever is there who has used the machine before how to use it correctly and safely. Now here you can see the example of when you've got not autoclave versus autoclaved. So this is the way that we know that the media has been properly sterilized. And then after once the autoclave is over, we keep in mind that the bottles and the liquids will be extremely hot. So make sure that you've got gloves or some type of protective wear in order to remove the bottles or just wait for a certain amount of time until it's cooled down a little bit. So media without agbar could then just be taken out and left at room temperature. But if you're making something such as LBI Gar or soft or sloppy, either, you don't want to put that oops, and that's a typo that should not be five that should be 50 to 60 degrees Celsius is gonna make a very big difference. So please take note of that. So if you're making anything with argon, you should let it equilibrate at a temperature of 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. Now this is usually done in either an incubator set at that temperature or in a water bath. And this is because when it comes out of the autoclave, it's super, super hot. And you need to let the temperature cool down to a working temperature where the Aguilar is still in its liquid phase, but that won't burn through your plates or your tubes or kill your bacteria. So another thing to keep in mind is make sure you know we opened it slightly before we put it into the autoclave.

And, yes, last reminder, eco delivery at the temperature desired before using and very, very important. Before you would use any of the media you've made containing anger, you know, we shake shook it really well before we put it into the autoclave, but when you take it out, look at it. Again, you'll probably have this sort of sedimentation onto the bottom. So when you take anything with ag or before making plates or doing with anything with the soft dagger, make sure you give it a good shake. Sometimes you'll see the Eiger sort of swirl around and then redistribute in the bottle. Because what happens is if you don't do that, and you take maybe say from this top layer, it doesn't contain as much anger from the bottom and you'll have inconsistent percentages a bag or or even the anger won't solidify. So give it a good shake before using it. Like that. All right, so just a quick word about storing media. The first thing you should ask yourself is does it have Aguilar in it or not? So if not like the lb broth we talked about earlier you Just take it out and leave it at room temperature. Now, if it does contain IR, if you want to use it right away, then you should put it into this incubator or water bath at 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. And this way, it'll cool it down to a working temperature. And if you want to keep it for using later, you can leave it at room temperature at which point it will solidify. But then keep in mind, you have to have some way to remelt it if you want to use it in the future. So maybe a microwave or something, I don't really like to do this, it's kind of a pain. But if that's the way you do things in the lab or the way you have to because you make in a different location, that's okay, just keep in mind, you're going to need to have some way to melt it again, before you could use it in any experiments. And another quick word about using a water bath is that Be careful if you leave something in a water bath too long because contaminations can occur. I've seen this a lot because the water itself can get quite dirty. And then if there's a little drop that gets in, it can infect or contaminate your media. So that brings us on to the last topic, which is contaminations. So what you can see here is that a mold somehow got into the plate, and now has contaminated this this was previously used for bacterial culture. Now this can happen on plates, for example that you've just stored. So say you poured our plates, and you leave them on your bench to cool down and use them the next day. If there's any type of small spores in the air. Or if you weren't using a Bunsen burner or something like that, it's possible that your plates could get a mold like growth on them. And really, what's important is always just to look and check your material before you're using it. So look for mold, or if you're looking at the the liquid media itself, pick up the bottle and swirl it around. And if you see then afterwards, if there's a sort of spiral or like a little hurricane of something inside your media, it's probably because it's contaminated. And you definitely shouldn't use it for your experiments. So again, be careful if you're using a water bath, try not to use a water bath for increased periods of time, like I'll use it for the experiment I'm doing and then I shut it off. So my tubes are in the water only for a few hours. But if you're using it to store your your media really have to make sure that the water itself as well as clean, or you're running an increased risk of contamination. And lastly, if you're pouring our plates, try to store them at four degrees after they've solidified. And until you're ready to use them. And this will also decrease your risk of contamination. So in conclusion, always, always ask about local procedures that they're in place for making media. This can be different in different labs, the best thing to do is follow the protocol and the lab where you're at. Always ask questions and be careful when you're using an autoclave. And then secondly, that's it, use your autoclave, be safe, most important. And then make sure that you will shake your media before you pour plates or doing any type of experiments to really mix that Eiger really well. And then lastly, check for contaminations. So I hope that was helpful. And just a quick reminder for some on how to use and sterilize media properly. Make sure that you're starting off your experiments with something sterile, and that the results you obtain are what you want to see and not because you're married, your media wasn't sterilized property.

And then make sure that you will shake your media before you pour plates or doing any type of experiments to really mix that Eiger really well. And then lastly, check for contaminations. So I hope that was helpful. And just a quick reminder for some on how to use and sterilize media properly. Make sure that you're starting off your experiments with something sterile, and that the results you obtain are what you want to see and not because you're married, your media wasn't sterilized property. So thank you and good luck with your experiments.\n\n"]},{"id":"e4f75134-ff07-4a4c-8e2a-37e55ed2b6e9","type":"text","value":"Unknown Speaker 13:41","properties":{"title":[["Unknown Speaker

0:00\n\n","    Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory. In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.\n\n","    So the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.\n\n","    We have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.\n\n","    phages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.\n\n","    Here's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.\n\n","    We accomplish this mission in two general programs. The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.\n\n","    So these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.\n\n","    From their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.\n\n","    Our first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process. And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019. And we actually had participants from six different countries in West Africa that was hosted in Ghana. And then most recently, in January 2020. We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.\n\n","    Let me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform. We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops. In the most recent East Africa workshop. They came from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, they represented 14 different institutions. And they came from all different levels within their careers, graduate students, technicians, research assistants, lecturers, professors, professors and government scientists. And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.\n\n","    funders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible. So we're very grateful for this community involvement.\n\n","    At this workshop, we had our three original instructors, Professor Martha cloaky, from the University of Leicester, in the UK, and Dr. Janet nali. Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching. This time we had Slav, mich new ski from the University of Warwick in the UK.\n\n","    And the goals of each workshop are not only to learn phage biology and experimental techniques, but also this is really important to develop a network of phage researchers starting in the given region, East Africa or say Southeast Asia, and then helping to connect them to other researchers throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US are America and\n\n","    the topics covered include phage, ecology, molecular biology, various models for studying how phages interact with their bacteria phage applications in agriculture, including both animals and crops, phage therapy, compassionate use cases as well as clinical trials. And then each of the instructors talks about their current area of phage research to give some very practical examples of how phages might be applied. We also try to help the participants of the workshop prepare to get funding for their phage product projects, and also how to engage with the public that might be with a few\n\n","    consumers of their phage product, the regulatory authorities, whoever it may be,\n\n","    to get the support, they'll need to get phages utilized in their country. And then we're constantly compiling collection of key scientific publications. And we discussed that many of those during the workshops.\n\n","    So just to give you an idea, at the end of the first two week workshop, as I said, which was hosted in Uganda in 2017, we were able to successfully isolate some phages, we being the participants of the workshop with support from the instructors. And so here are some transmission electron microscope images, microscopic images of some of the phages that were isolated. We've named these all up for Uganda phage, to a through five B. These were originally isolated from a sewage plant outside Kampala, Uganda, pure originally purified in Uganda and then further characterized back in the UK. And all of these have been made available to the participants of the workshop. So it's exciting to see that within just two weeks, phages can begin to be isolated by these workshop participants.\n\n","    I mentioned that the network develop and the development and the relationships is a really important part of this. And I'm highlighting this spend a few hours together in a sewage plant, and it's a very bonding experience. You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.\n\n","    So let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.\n\n","    Starting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.\n\n","    Then after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And\n\n","    then, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants. So they were either starting new projects or significantly modifying projects that they'd previously initiated, because they'd learned some key things from attending our workshop. There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.\n\n","    Even more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.\n\n","    And at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first\n\n","    from all of the\n\n","    workshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's\n\n","    Just within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.\n\n","    So now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.\n\n","    Our intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries. And it's akin to this saying from Lao Tzu and Martha cookie first made this slide. If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. And so as Martha rewarded this, if you give a woman or man a phage, you may treat one infection. Teach a woman or man how to isolate phages and you may treat multiple infections caused by many different pathogens. And that's our goal and hope here. Thanks much.\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n","  &lt;a  rel=prefetch href=\"/lectures\" class=\"_button __cta __width-full _margin-top-2 _margin-bottom-none-i\"&gt;Explore our phage lectures&lt;/a&gt;\n\n"],"children":["355baba6-8a4a-4f83-99ad-f0daccbb63e8","d5994f1d-693d-44c5-bc6b-ae38859d28ff","04ab2ccd-b475-4528-8b74-34fd11acb1a8","e15810e1-b8af-42f8-98a1-b9f2b019d45e","d8168f97-7df0-41b9-92a9-f2720da84a05","3120190e-9616-442b-b80c-4bc40e1f6aae","fd9d7b53-b8c6-481e-8a84-b0e206168abd","9c79e99c-f3b6-4848-bf6e-62c93f3304af"],"content":[{"id":"355baba6-8a4a-4f83-99ad-f0daccbb63e8","type":"text","parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"d5994f1d-693d-44c5-bc6b-ae38859d28ff","type":"text","value":"Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!","properties":{"title":[["Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!"]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!\n\n"]},{"id":"04ab2ccd-b475-4528-8b74-34fd11acb1a8","type":"text","parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"e15810e1-b8af-42f8-98a1-b9f2b019d45e","type":"text","value":"Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions.","properties":{"title":[["Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions."]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions.\n\n"]},{"id":"d8168f97-7df0-41b9-92a9-f2720da84a05","type":"text","parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"3120190e-9616-442b-b80c-4bc40e1f6aae","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","              Tobi Nagel 0:00\n\n","              Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory.

There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.\n\n","              Even more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.\n\n","              And at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first\n\n","              from all of the\n\n","              workshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's\n\n","              Just within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.\n\n","              So now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.\n\n","              Our intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries. And it's akin to this saying from Lao Tzu and Martha cookie first made this slide. If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. And so as Martha rewarded this, if you give a woman or man a phage, you may treat one infection. Teach a woman or man how to isolate phages and you may treat multiple infections caused by many different pathogens. And that's our goal and hope here. Thanks much.\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["5374a5ec-812f-4849-b706-f704952fc3e6","72016cbd-756f-40f0-8b14-9c8cb2c10659","fd38468d-1e7c-4dc6-baaf-19d02af0f48e","e96fec0f-a3f5-4d5f-b564-bc5d489eb870","66bf3ba8-1894-4102-971c-627e19bd4d5c","d70f8ccd-efc6-4938-b9f8-f7fe764b84d6","1bc7dc1d-fed7-4ae5-a3de-9db555b1b532","3c45e6f8-13a4-4970-9b2f-e97dd6409258","03685f47-c465-4de6-89fa-8ef63d0e9620","41e10795-363f-4635-bd19-b6e7c37b4d5f","bed4f10a-3858-42b4-8355-462e449f6842","85d1fa8a-eeac-44cc-a4ae-578348c091fe","6fbdb087-a215-4d40-bda8-4a6d2f01b430","7b3dec5e-eb5f-432c-83ee-e0166ac42a33","4625f180-6d42-4904-8328-58a1fa883c1f","d786c9d7-4003-43aa-a1e3-d50670c41fba","982ed912-c796-4190-9ef5-303319472d35","bf0ed75a-b380-48cd-981d-87c13e8c2f12","1c2e30c2-b83c-4d59-9746-b772e0650e28","409683ff-8715-408c-a6bf-2981b336a795","5aa06999-fbb7-4fe6-8d47-ca29f37eb0b1","b8da7dad-9270-4b33-97b4-1f50f3fe977b","23cc5e3a-049a-46ac-be88-f558d6ec0e92","3cf342a9-ff77-41f1-8353-0dcdb050d5eb","dfef9cc2-f73c-48bf-b0bf-b9711901d19d","1bf59dc5-2e65-4cd1-a8f0-734b95f2d4a0","dc38e83c-c885-43dd-a756-50fd9d2e9c06","654647f7-2a30-4690-927d-8e5927fc33dc","b1c35071-dfa0-4646-8ded-961da0026d84","2509a1d6-3ce8-4f6e-9206-9e02d3a21726"],"content":[{"id":"5374a5ec-812f-4849-b706-f704952fc3e6","type":"text","value":"Tobi Nagel 0:00","properties":{"title":[["Tobi Nagel 0:00"]]},"parent_id":"3120190e-9616-442b-b80c-4bc40e1f6aae","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Tobi Nagel 0:00\n\n"]},{"id":"72016cbd-756f-40f0-8b14-9c8cb2c10659","type":"text","value":"Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory.

auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:02\n\n","    Hi there. Today I thought we'd talk about phage therapy. So I have a few sort of lectures will break them up into several pieces about phage therapy, and we'll talk about compassionate use cases, mostly Shauna, in another series of lectures is going to talk to you about clinical trials. I'm going to talk about more than one off cases. But we'll talk about some of the principles of face therapy before that, and we'll get to that in just a minute. So just to get you guys excited for it, I thought I'd introduce the case first. And this was the first case that we treated Yale, this was back in 2016. And it was one of the more sort of recent big cases that sort of, well, it's sort of started the momentum phage therapy, sort of helped bring it where it is, a so this case is the case of a prosthetic vascular graft infection with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And so this case started with an 80 year old male that had an aortic aneurysm. And what that is, is this vessel coming out of the heart that walls will slightly weakened, and it started bleeding out. And if this ruptures to\n\n","    catastrophic\n\n","    event, and certainly fatal, and so when there's sign of an aneurism like this, especially in the aorta, it needs to be repaired. And so what happened was this individual went under, and went to surgery and had an aortic arch replacement. And so what they did is they cut off a chunk of the aorta, and they replaced it with a piece of paper on and so they grafted this onto the aorta back in 2012. And so, you know, shortly after, after infection, and hit a, you know, a really bad infection post surgery, which spread to the sternum and actually eventually had to go in and remove the sternum and a lot of bone.\n\n","    As a result,\n\n","    in 2013, he came back to hospital with bacteremia, especially with monus. And then he also had draining fistula. So what that was, is there was basically a whole draining from his chest. He also had environment that was draining process and Pseudomonas. And its origin was a face of getting worse. When this happened, they manage this infection with iv subterra, Diem, and Cipro and then they also provided more the chest wall. And then they sent them home. But he was admitted three additional times in 2013, with, you know, increased drainage from the fistula, and bacteremia again, so he would be on antibiotics, he'd stopped taking them after the course was done. And then five days later, he would be back screaming. So for those of you that may not know what a meme is, it's when there's bacteria in the blood. So it's a pretty serious infection. Okay, so in October 2014, he had a imaging done, and it showed an increase of fluid at the base of the aorta, which is how they identified the infection site and the cultures that they pulled from the drainage or intermediate resistant to Cipro. And so they started IPsec. Again, and just as before, when he would stop taking sagacity he had fever and vektory me again. So this went on for another year. So he's been on antibiotics for, geez, two years now. And then by late 2015, actually, some blood started coming out of this fistula. And it was concerning because people thought that maybe the infection had eroded into the base of the aorta, and it was leaking a little bit. And if that happens, you know, that's the equivalent of an aneurysm rupturing. So this is a problem because, due to his advanced age, they couldn't go in and surgically remove the graft and replace it with a different\n\n","    one.\n\n","    And so, because of risk of mortality, so we were looking for alternative ways of which we might treat this case. This is our first case. We'll talk more about it later. Before we get there, I thought we'd talk about some of these a couple of historic cases. So these are from courtesy of a friend of mine from country of Georgia, who told me about these cases. And they were, these four cases happened in Georgia. And the first one is a radiation burn on those infected with Staph aureus. So this individual had a pretty severe radiation Bernice can see on a zero here, which failed to resolve after a month of hospitalization. The then treated him they started treating them with bacteria phages, with a product called h biodome, which is like a bandage that's, that contains pages for staff equal, like klebsiella, and Pseudomonas. So they basically placed this bandage on his burn daily. And then by day seven, basically, that was the the wound looked like it was improving, as you can see in the photos here, and it was less drainage of us. And when they did cultures of the wound, they saw that they were negative. So it looks like phages, in combination with antibiotics might have helped resolve\n\n","    that wound.\n\n","    And the next one is a severe wound as you can see, those infected by Pseudomonas, and this was a 46 year old male with severe trauma to the left forum. He had this injury, fishing accident, he was fishing with explosives, legally, and he was injured. So on day three, there, you can see that he has a very severe trauma to his arm. And cultures of arm revealed Pseudomonas and staph epidermidis. So they began treating with obviously, in addition to chemical and biotics, they treated with phage, your Georgian product called pFh, which contains pages that kill staph, strep pneumo, of pneumo, echolife, Proteus, and Pseudomonas. So they were basically irrigating this wound site with it, there was some improvement by day seven, as you can see, and obviously, they've, they've been doing surgery consistently to remove active tissue, dead tissue, and to try and preserve the hand. On day 10. He had some vessels rupture and repair in emergency surgery. See, but basically, you know, by six months, he's of constant phage treatment and antibiotic treatment and surgical intervention, he's able to retain his limb here. And so you know, these these sort of cases are exciting and suggest that maybe phage have a role to play in infection management, particularly and drug resistant infections. So one of the differences between phages and antibiotics, right, so there's actually quite a few. They're both tools that are used to try and kill bacteria. In phage therapy, you know, they used to treat infection logically, but they're different than chemical antibiotics in some ways. So for chemical antibiotics, you sort of need to know that the knowledge of the infectious strain, within reason, oftentimes, they'll treat with antibiotics, water waiting for cultures to come back, at least in the US. phages, you definitely need to know what strain is causing the infection, because phage are very, very specific in their killing. And so it's very easy to give the wrong phage. If you don't know what strain and actually test with strain is causing the infection phage particles are also quite large, especially compared to chemical antibiotics, maybe 10,000 times the size, at least. And so this can bring up a bunch of issues in terms of potential immune recognition, which we'll talk about in one of the compassionate cases later. dosage is critical for chemical antibiotics to lower the dose know that with a bunch of antibiotic resistant bacteria and no change in clinical status too high and you have the issue of toxicity. dose in phage is also critical, but I think it's less calculate. Generally phage treatment is a function of multiplicity of infection. So the number of pages are bacteria. And so determining does is a little bit difficult functional dose that is, but the dose is also difficult because once you've administered phage, and they start killing bacteria, they're going to replicate right so this is going to change your effective dose in the body. A resistance to phages evolves very quickly, especially individual phages. If you grow them in the lab, as you'll do in this course, you'll find that that phages, resistance to these phages evolves overnight. It with chemical antibiotics, it actually can evolve a bit slower, depending on the antibiotic, and the mechanism of resistance. Some bacteria just don't have these mechanisms in place to be resistant, so we can take quite a while to evolve them. Okay, so at about a toxicity can be very high to do relatively low, right. So there are some lastline antibiotics that are extremely toxic, but use them as a drug of last resort. phages, on the other hand, seem to have a very high therapeutic index that is that they're very appear very safe, right. So independent of dose, you don't seem to see negative side effects. And over several orders of magnitude, which is much different than you would expect from a chemical and about. So we're different ministration is variable in both chemical and bage.\n\n","    demonstrated efficacy, clear the antibiotics if demonstrated history of working, whereas phages we're working on it still, at least in the US, Canada and Western Europe. Intellectual property, which is sort of a driver for a lot of companies is trivial in antibiotics, right? You identify a new compound patent on it, and then you're okay. phages, it's different because they're, you know, considered living organisms. And so intellectual property can be a bit more\n\n","    complicated.\n\n","    And then, as I said previously, the spectrum of activity for phages is extremely narrow, oftentimes phages, in fact, one or a couple of strains, whereas chemical antibiotics, it's relatively broad, it's certainly at least compared to\n\n","    bacteria phages. So if you're going to end up trying to develop\n\n","    phage, as a therapeutic, there's a few things that want you to consider and this is clearly a not comprehensive list, but consider at least some of the right the relevant ministration is critical. Will the phage be exposed to low pH salinity? How would they get to the bacteria. So if you have a blood infection, and you give a pill, the phages exposed to the stomach, and then how many of them are actually going to cross from the digestive system into the blood? Right, this is a very important question. And you want to be sure that the phage actually get to the site so that they can do their job. immune response is a another consideration. So as I mentioned before, there are large particles, so the immune system will eventually recognize them. And navigating that space can be difficult. So you want to be sure that we're not just giving IV phage for every possible infection, because the immune system is going to be involved. Those is going to be important. So you're going to have to figure out what the best functional doses. And there's a bunch of trade offs around dosing. Obviously, there's some you might need to dilute your product down if you can't purify it as well. But also, you need to be sure that you're giving enough phage that they actually can do their job, because it's not like one phage particle, gets into a wound and then clears all the bacteria. In theory, this is what happens, what could happen at least. But in practice, this is not know what happens phage have to find a bacteria in replicating. And it's actually although you know, it appears to be a small infectious site. Viruses are ages bacteria, they're all very, very, very small, right? So even if you have bacteria, you know, a 10th of a millimeter away. That's a long distance to travel and a phage that doesn't have a way to move, it has to work on Brownian motion to end up getting there. And that's not simple as it might seem. The composition of the process and be critical. Like Are there going to be other chemicals in the phage product that are antagonistic or they kill the phage stuff to consider is the phage stable in this excipient these are things you're gonna have to test before you deploy your phage you also need to know the storage conditions for the product, for example, you know, is it gonna be refrigerated frozen, these things are all gonna be critical and be especially important as you try and develop phages in a large scale. So route of administration, as I said is critical. How, how this happens is going to be um, you know, I listed five of them here. Um, for example, eye drops. So you know, There's been phage that have just been applied a traffic to it to treat an infection. And there's you know, injection, whether it's into the circulatory system or just into muscles tissue this way. They're suppository or also by mouth. So that said, you know, pills or little capsules, you can take a phage to try and treat some infections. One that we've done a lot recently is naturalization. So, we have basically did the inhalation that phages via nebulizer a and then you know, in any other way that drugs have been delivered, and perhaps some that haven't been so what your goal should be when you're developing this product is to select a route of administration that maximizes delivery, maximizes the delivery of viable phages while minimizing the risk to the patient, if so, be a nebulizer, it, in theory will help treat a lung infection. The nebulizer itself, maybe aerosolized in the phages, damages the phages, just to be sure that page actually are functional, as they get to the discussion site is tied to the infection site. And you want to minimize the rest of the patient at the same time, obviously. Alright, so let's talk about immune response here. So as we were saying that large particles and the adaptive immune system will eventually recognize\n\n","    bacteriophage.\n\n","    So does this impact therapy? Like it might not? But as it, I would imagine, it probably does. And that's something that needs to be investigated. What happens when the age do their well, and they kill a bunch of bacteria, lice in the bacteria, and all these endo and EXO toxins just burst out of the bacteria that can elicit a pretty strong immune response. And these are things to consider when you're developing a treatment. So what about dosing? How many pages should we give? How frequently should we apply them? For example, right? So should you just give, as this cartoon suggests, you know, some agent day, one day, two day three day, or should you just throw it all in on day one, just go for it and do a one and done situation. Um, it depends on the infection, it's going to depend on severity, infection, individual patient is going to depend a lot. Um, so in terms of dosing, we're also going to talk about multiplicity of infection, as is often abbreviated m i. And it's simply the number of viral particles per bacteria in a system, right? So if you have a flask, and you're trying to, and you have 10, to the seven bacteria per mil, and there's 10 mils, there's 10 of eight total bacteria. With those 10 and eight bacteria, are you and you want an MRI of 100, you have to add 10 to the 10, platforming units of phage. Okay, so an MRI of 100 means 100, platforming units of bacteria, or phage, or bacteria. Okay, so hypothetically, if you're trying to remove 10 to the seventh bacteria from a liquid culture in a single infection cycle 10 to the seven phage is enough, right? So you're throwing one phage particle and for every bacteria nut should be sufficient to kill everyone,\n\n","    right?\n\n","    No, that's actually\n\n","    NASA do with sort of random distribution. Okay, so it's a bit of math here, it's not really critical unless you're interested in it. But it's here to illustrate sort of theory, okay. So if you look at the cosine distribution, it's the equivalent of, you know, if you have, you know, if we were actually in a different time, and we're chatting in person, and you add, you know, 100 students in this class, 10 rows of 10. And I had, you know, a bucket of 100, tennis balls and one tennis ball for each of you. And I just threw them out, you know, just took the bucket and launched it out at you. The probability that everyone gets one is very low, right, the probability that some of you get none very high probability if someone gets to is also a possibility, right. And so, when you are trying to solve these sort of, you know, hypotheticals here, you basically solve the fraction of uninfected cells which is zero. So the first equation here is the fraction of the population it's not infected. The next equation, where k equals one is the number of bacteria that are single phage. And then you know, after that, you can just look at actual infected by more than page Okay. So, um, when you do that, it will help you understand the minimum number of pages you need in order to expose all the bacteria to at least one phage particle initial administration. Okay. So for like a, you know, hypothetical example here, imagine that Jerry can actually see these are boys that are used to collect water in many parts of the world. And so, you know, in a typical Jared candidate 20 leaders say you fetched water from a river and it contains a total in this can have 10 to the nine, see if he's a video call, right, so there's a cholera outbreak upstream and down here in the water, you have cholera. So, if they're 10 to the ninth Cfu is a Vibrio, there's 5% for CFS per ml M. And if you just took 10 to that IPF use of video footage so you see knew you had a face that could kill this video, we had to tend to the night phage This is an MRI of 110 of the night face and like bacteria. When you crunch through randomly mixing and do the math, the number of bacteria that are never exposed to phage on the first encounter is 367 million CFCs. Right. So this first number here infects 20,000 people in can. So if you use mo I have one and treat. There's still enough bacteria in this can not been exposed to page. There's enough bacteria in this chair can infect 4000 people. Okay, so what if instead of 10 to the ninth, we made an MRI of 10. So we had a 10 to the 10th ef use the same jerrycan and mixed it up. We had the number of bacteria that were not exposed to a phage 450 cF use is not enough to cause an infection. In most people, the overwhelming majority people do and just for DCF use, you're not going to get an MRI of 10. If you can treat this jerrycan with ny 10 it should make it clean enough to drink. So, you know in summary that ensuring that bacteria exposed to the phage immediately upon dosing. If you're going to do that, then you need to try for MIF 10 right? Otherwise, you have to rely on either frequent dosing or replication within those and replication within the person is difficult to depend on. Is this it's just there's a lot of variables. So how do you determine the bacterial density? Right so someone comes in with you know klebsiella pneumoniae infection and pneumonia say, How do you know how many bacteria they have? Very difficult. You probably can't. But the best you can do is estimate. And then even still, it's pretty accurate. But you know, our general policy is to try and throw as many pages as possible at it while maintaining safety. And so that's sort of the approach we've taken, we've more or less standardized our dose here for some of these respiratory infections.\n\n","    But as I'd say the deaths would be completely different from other infections or even other bacteria. And we just picked a dose that sort of maximize the number of pages while minimizing the number of toxins and staying within the current FDA regulations.\n\n","    \n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["8613afc2-cb51-4029-ad65-943b5a41176a"],"content":[{"id":"8613afc2-cb51-4029-ad65-943b5a41176a","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"2514b2e7-7f71-42a4-9610-2ec5493d6414","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:02\n\n","    Hi there. Today I thought we'd talk about phage therapy. So I have a few sort of lectures will break them up into several pieces about phage therapy, and we'll talk about compassionate use cases, mostly Shauna, in another series of lectures is going to talk to you about clinical trials. I'm going to talk about more than one off cases. But we'll talk about some of the principles of face therapy before that, and we'll get to that in just a minute. So just to get you guys excited for it, I thought I'd introduce the case first. And this was the first case that we treated Yale, this was back in 2016. And it was one of the more sort of recent big cases that sort of, well, it's sort of started the momentum phage therapy, sort of helped bring it where it is, a so this case is the case of a prosthetic vascular graft infection with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And so this case started with an 80 year old male that had an aortic aneurysm. And what that is, is this vessel coming out of the heart that walls will slightly weakened, and it started bleeding out. And if this ruptures to\n\n","    catastrophic\n\n","    event, and certainly fatal, and so when there's sign of an aneurism like this, especially in the aorta, it needs to be repaired. And so what happened was this individual went under, and went to surgery and had an aortic arch replacement. And so what they did is they cut off a chunk of the aorta, and they replaced it with a piece of paper on and so they grafted this onto the aorta back in 2012. And so, you know, shortly after, after infection, and hit a, you know, a really bad infection post surgery, which spread to the sternum and actually eventually had to go in and remove the sternum and a lot of bone.\n\n","    As a result,\n\n","    in 2013, he came back to hospital with bacteremia, especially with monus. And then he also had draining fistula. So what that was, is there was basically a whole draining from his chest. He also had environment that was draining process and Pseudomonas. And its origin was a face of getting worse. When this happened, they manage this infection with iv subterra, Diem, and Cipro and then they also provided more the chest wall. And then they sent them home. But he was admitted three additional times in 2013, with, you know, increased drainage from the fistula, and bacteremia again, so he would be on antibiotics, he'd stopped taking them after the course was done. And then five days later, he would be back screaming. So for those of you that may not know what a meme is, it's when there's bacteria in the blood. So it's a pretty serious infection. Okay, so in October 2014, he had a imaging done, and it showed an increase of fluid at the base of the aorta, which is how they identified the infection site and the cultures that they pulled from the drainage or intermediate resistant to Cipro. And so they started IPsec. Again, and just as before, when he would stop taking sagacity he had fever and vektory me again. So this went on for another year. So he's been on antibiotics for, geez, two years now. And then by late 2015, actually, some blood started coming out of this fistula. And it was concerning because people thought that maybe the infection had eroded into the base of the aorta, and it was leaking a little bit. And if that happens, you know, that's the equivalent of an aneurysm rupturing. So this is a problem because, due to his advanced age, they couldn't go in and surgically remove the graft and replace it with a different\n\n","    one.\n\n","    And so, because of risk of mortality, so we were looking for alternative ways of which we might treat this case. This is our first case. We'll talk more about it later. Before we get there, I thought we'd talk about some of these a couple of historic cases. So these are from courtesy of a friend of mine from country of Georgia, who told me about these cases. And they were, these four cases happened in Georgia. And the first one is a radiation burn on those infected with Staph aureus. So this individual had a pretty severe radiation Bernice can see on a zero here, which failed to resolve after a month of hospitalization. The then treated him they started treating them with bacteria phages, with a product called h biodome, which is like a bandage that's, that contains pages for staff equal, like klebsiella, and Pseudomonas. So they basically placed this bandage on his burn daily. And then by day seven, basically, that was the the wound looked like it was improving, as you can see in the photos here, and it was less drainage of us. And when they did cultures of the wound, they saw that they were negative. So it looks like phages, in combination with antibiotics might have helped resolve\n\n","    that wound.\n\n","    And the next one is a severe wound as you can see, those infected by Pseudomonas, and this was a 46 year old male with severe trauma to the left forum. He had this injury, fishing accident, he was fishing with explosives, legally, and he was injured. So on day three, there, you can see that he has a very severe trauma to his arm. And cultures of arm revealed Pseudomonas and staph epidermidis. So they began treating with obviously, in addition to chemical and biotics, they treated with phage, your Georgian product called pFh, which contains pages that kill staph, strep pneumo, of pneumo, echolife, Proteus, and Pseudomonas. So they were basically irrigating this wound site with it, there was some improvement by day seven, as you can see, and obviously, they've, they've been doing surgery consistently to remove active tissue, dead tissue, and to try and preserve the hand. On day 10. He had some vessels rupture and repair in emergency surgery. See, but basically, you know, by six months, he's of constant phage treatment and antibiotic treatment and surgical intervention, he's able to retain his limb here. And so you know, these these sort of cases are exciting and suggest that maybe phage have a role to play in infection management, particularly and drug resistant infections. So one of the differences between phages and antibiotics, right, so there's actually quite a few. They're both tools that are used to try and kill bacteria. In phage therapy, you know, they used to treat infection logically, but they're different than chemical antibiotics in some ways. So for chemical antibiotics, you sort of need to know that the knowledge of the infectious strain, within reason, oftentimes, they'll treat with antibiotics, water waiting for cultures to come back, at least in the US. phages, you definitely need to know what strain is causing the infection, because phage are very, very specific in their killing. And so it's very easy to give the wrong phage. If you don't know what strain and actually test with strain is causing the infection phage particles are also quite large, especially compared to chemical antibiotics, maybe 10,000 times the size, at least. And so this can bring up a bunch of issues in terms of potential immune recognition, which we'll talk about in one of the compassionate cases later. dosage is critical for chemical antibiotics to lower the dose know that with a bunch of antibiotic resistant bacteria and no change in clinical status too high and you have the issue of toxicity. dose in phage is also critical, but I think it's less calculate.

But as it, I would imagine, it probably does. And that's something that needs to be investigated. What happens when the age do their well, and they kill a bunch of bacteria, lice in the bacteria, and all these endo and EXO toxins just burst out of the bacteria that can elicit a pretty strong immune response. And these are things to consider when you're developing a treatment. So what about dosing? How many pages should we give? How frequently should we apply them? For example, right? So should you just give, as this cartoon suggests, you know, some agent day, one day, two day three day, or should you just throw it all in on day one, just go for it and do a one and done situation. Um, it depends on the infection, it's going to depend on severity, infection, individual patient is going to depend a lot. Um, so in terms of dosing, we're also going to talk about multiplicity of infection, as is often abbreviated m i. And it's simply the number of viral particles per bacteria in a system, right? So if you have a flask, and you're trying to, and you have 10, to the seven bacteria per mil, and there's 10 mils, there's 10 of eight total bacteria. With those 10 and eight bacteria, are you and you want an MRI of 100, you have to add 10 to the 10, platforming units of phage. Okay, so an MRI of 100 means 100, platforming units of bacteria, or phage, or bacteria. Okay, so hypothetically, if you're trying to remove 10 to the seventh bacteria from a liquid culture in a single infection cycle 10 to the seven phage is enough, right? So you're throwing one phage particle and for every bacteria nut should be sufficient to kill everyone,\n\n","    right?\n\n","    No, that's actually\n\n","    NASA do with sort of random distribution. Okay, so it's a bit of math here, it's not really critical unless you're interested in it. But it's here to illustrate sort of theory, okay. So if you look at the cosine distribution, it's the equivalent of, you know, if you have, you know, if we were actually in a different time, and we're chatting in person, and you add, you know, 100 students in this class, 10 rows of 10. And I had, you know, a bucket of 100, tennis balls and one tennis ball for each of you. And I just threw them out, you know, just took the bucket and launched it out at you. The probability that everyone gets one is very low, right, the probability that some of you get none very high probability if someone gets to is also a possibility, right. And so, when you are trying to solve these sort of, you know, hypotheticals here, you basically solve the fraction of uninfected cells which is zero. So the first equation here is the fraction of the population it's not infected. The next equation, where k equals one is the number of bacteria that are single phage. And then you know, after that, you can just look at actual infected by more than page Okay. So, um, when you do that, it will help you understand the minimum number of pages you need in order to expose all the bacteria to at least one phage particle initial administration. Okay. So for like a, you know, hypothetical example here, imagine that Jerry can actually see these are boys that are used to collect water in many parts of the world. And so, you know, in a typical Jared candidate 20 leaders say you fetched water from a river and it contains a total in this can have 10 to the nine, see if he's a video call, right, so there's a cholera outbreak upstream and down here in the water, you have cholera. So, if they're 10 to the ninth Cfu is a Vibrio, there's 5% for CFS per ml M. And if you just took 10 to that IPF use of video footage so you see knew you had a face that could kill this video, we had to tend to the night phage This is an MRI of 110 of the night face and like bacteria. When you crunch through randomly mixing and do the math, the number of bacteria that are never exposed to phage on the first encounter is 367 million CFCs. Right. So this first number here infects 20,000 people in can. So if you use mo I have one and treat. There's still enough bacteria in this can not been exposed to page. There's enough bacteria in this chair can infect 4000 people. Okay, so what if instead of 10 to the ninth, we made an MRI of 10. So we had a 10 to the 10th ef use the same jerrycan and mixed it up. We had the number of bacteria that were not exposed to a phage 450 cF use is not enough to cause an infection. In most people, the overwhelming majority people do and just for DCF use, you're not going to get an MRI of 10. If you can treat this jerrycan with ny 10 it should make it clean enough to drink. So, you know in summary that ensuring that bacteria exposed to the phage immediately upon dosing. If you're going to do that, then you need to try for MIF 10 right? Otherwise, you have to rely on either frequent dosing or replication within those and replication within the person is difficult to depend on. Is this it's just there's a lot of variables. So how do you determine the bacterial density? Right so someone comes in with you know klebsiella pneumoniae infection and pneumonia say, How do you know how many bacteria they have? Very difficult.

In most people, the overwhelming majority people do and just for DCF use, you're not going to get an MRI of 10. If you can treat this jerrycan with ny 10 it should make it clean enough to drink. So, you know in summary that ensuring that bacteria exposed to the phage immediately upon dosing. If you're going to do that, then you need to try for MIF 10 right? Otherwise, you have to rely on either frequent dosing or replication within those and replication within the person is difficult to depend on. Is this it's just there's a lot of variables. So how do you determine the bacterial density? Right so someone comes in with you know klebsiella pneumoniae infection and pneumonia say, How do you know how many bacteria they have? Very difficult. You probably can't. But the best you can do is estimate. And then even still, it's pretty accurate. But you know, our general policy is to try and throw as many pages as possible at it while maintaining safety. And so that's sort of the approach we've taken, we've more or less standardized our dose here for some of these respiratory infections.\n\n"]},{"id":"2866aa70-05ec-4850-a634-e54f00657695","type":"text","value":"But as I'd say the deaths would be completely different from other infections or even other bacteria.

And so I think it's worth actually taking a few minutes to find it. So, page binding is a pretty complicated process actually requiring recognition by the bacteria phage have specific receptor or receptors that are expressed on the surface of bacteria. So in my cartoon here, on the left, the blue face, there's bouncing around in the environment, and then the green wood is the cell wall of the bacteria, right? So it comes into contact with some protein or sugar or fat or something. If it's not the right one, it bounces back off and doesn't find it, it doesn't bind. So these receptors are present necessarily on all members of a genus, and usually not even all members of a species, right. So it is or, as we said, you know, countless times during the series, incredibly specific, eight. And so part of that specificity, a pretty good chunk of it is due to just h 90 b being able to find material, not recognizing the appropriate receptor. So, you know, once it does find the appropriate receptor, it binds to it and then continues its its reproductive process, as we discussed in previous lectures, right. So specificity as is so complicated. And it means that material failure credibly host specific, and this is good or bad. Right? So, I guess I would say it depends take difficult to get a solid answer, I know, depends, right. So, historically, it was considered bad, because you need to know a lot of information about the spectra in order to determine whether this page can be used. However, now that we're appreciating the microbiome, and we're recognizing all these like collateral damage from some of these other antimicrobials, I think we're coming to appreciate the microbiome and its value to health. And so I think the specificity, specificity is actually quite good in that it allows for like a really personalized medicine. So let's consider the specificity here, or maybe here as a form of infection. Patient pressure, right? So in this cartoon, the left of a circle of the life cycle bacteria phage, right. So in a closed system, bacteria grow phage grow, they're going to be constantly infecting the bacteria. However, within the population of bacteria, mutation, will up or standing diversity might be sufficient if it's already present, so that the phage can no longer kill trade eight. So this evolved resistance so clear that evolved resistance to particular phage could be directed right, I'm saying can be directed to reduce a reverse antibiotic resistance or possibly attenuate virulence, I mean by that is, if we're careful in choosing what the bacteria phage is using as it binds to its bacterial host, could select for a phage that utilizes some component of bacterial virulence or antibiotic resistance, such that when the bacteria mutate away from phage, and become resistant to them, it comes at a cost by being increased, seemingly sensitive to antibiotics or maybe having more sorry, decreased virulence. Right? So this lower right, is just showing that it's a trade off between phage sensitivity and antibiotic resistance are very cool. So, you know, in theory, that's great. But what about in practice? I'm going to show a few examples here on how at least in the lab, we can, we can demonstrate this trade off. Okay. So, starting with mucoid strains of Pseudomonas, right, so we have Phage, or several bacteria, Pseudomonas require now going to capsule to infect a, we'll get what that is in a minute. Here. In the bottom, I have a cartoon of Pseudomonas bacteria and those 10 colored antibodies, right. So normally, if it's swimming around in the body, antibodies can just stick on to some antigenic sites, flagging it, or destruction by the immune system. However, sometimes bacteria form a capsule. So in monus, it's more made out in it and it can actually Cover somebody\n\n","    antigenic sites, so that anybody can recognize the site anymore. Okay, well, we have phage that require a capsule in order to infect. And what the result is, is bacteria that evolve resistance to this age no longer amoeboid which could potentially be capitalized upon, you know, therapeutically, so that we can directly against New quality and perhaps work together with the immune system to help clear an infection. So in experimental work, we've shown that, you know, just just summarize that, we've shown that within three days, we can drive mucoid variants extinct with this page, which is the blue line here, and this is control phage, these different phage, which cannot infect mucoid bacteria, so this strain that we used is, has variants and amoeboid and non so right, so within a population, expose it to phage, and then we serially passaged it for three days. So in the orange line, it was a phage that cannot infect mucoid bacteria, and by the end of three days, we clearly see that mucoid bacteria are dominant, right, which makes sense, because they're resistant to page, on the blue one, the mucoid variants are sensitive to phage. And by day three, there, extinct, so everybody was none. Because this phage cannot infect non mucoid bacteria. So it's one way we can try and toggle equality in Pseudomonas, we can also target these outer membrane vesicles. So some of these outer membrane vesicles are just bits of cell wall that contain toxins, if they can promote adhesion and cause inflammation, destroy tissues, that kind of stuff. So basically, they're spewing out these little self icicles. So we have a bacteria that utilizes the O antigen, and origin of the bonus to say, in fact, in the resistant mutants do not have this antigen. And for some reason, which we're still investigating, this actually prevents them from producing remember signals. And so when we look in the supination of these bacteria that are resistant to phage. It shows evidence of this being the case,\n\n","    in that\n\n","    we look for the presence of the last days. So we did a simple last days essay, where we grew up the bacteria in the presence of Cipro flexisign, which is not known to have an impact on the last day of action. So at the end of the day, we wrote up in sub lethal concentrations of Cipro, spun it down quantify the last days and saw the last days, with erythromycin, which has been known to reduce elastase production. We grew it up, spin them down, testicle essays, it was negative, and the same thing happened with bacteria phage. satin is a it's another virulence factor secreted it causes oxidative stress and production of free radicals. it sprays out causing damage allowing the bacteria to action, we have a phage that when we expose bacteria to it and bacterial resistance, they reduce production of pass and almost zero, and I send an insect green pigment that is characteristic of Pseudomonas. We treated with sub lethal concentrations of antibiotics as well. Cipro carbenicillin, enough for my son, and this plot here is showing how much house and they are relative to the ancestor. After 48 hours, Cipro actually increased by seven, almost 50%. Relative to the ancestor, our carbon asanas was indistinguishable. erythromycin, a fourth column, the white one showed a big reduction. And then h6 is the fade all the way to right column, it should have big reduction, right? Interestingly, we were able to get rid of the increase due to Cipro by combining page of Super. Okay, so when you're designing a phage product, what's the competition gonna be like? I can use a single phage a cocktail pens, right? So it depends, like everything in therapeutics in biology. And there are cases in which a cocktail might be viable in cases in which a single phage over time might be and will hopefully try and make an argument for or single phage at the cocktail is pretty straightforward. But when we get to that point of lecture, discuss it. So if you consider the evolution of phage resistance when developing products, um, I think there can be a pretty strong case for serial model phage therapy, and we'll discuss in a minute, versus pulling them all together as a cocktail. We'll talk about that a bit later in some future slides here. But something else to consider is storage of phage. So many phases are stable for long periods of years with minimal loss of tighter at room temperature in media they were grown in. So we in the lab, one of the previous instructors of this course, Katie Wright, who's a student in the lab, she cracked open lysate of T six that was bottled in 1954, and still had locking tighter, and this is the year 2020. Um, so you know, 50, more than 50 years, at room temperature in, you know, liriope broth, and this still has pocking, tighter. And other faiths that we have, you know, within a week, we're down one order of magnitude. So it really is phage dependent. powdered formulations can be very, very, very stable, right? This, the ees laflife page can be stable for theoretically, you know, hundreds of years. Um, however, it can be costly to produce and optimize them to get the right sugar content. And you do lose some faith at the beginning, just as you would, if you were to store them at minus 80, you lose a bunch of pages beginning but then they're stable for basically forever until you rehydrate them or when you lose a bit more, but stability is definitely, um, the liquid formulation to be stable require more space also, right. So if your lab size is limited, and you need to store 10,000, phage, and you know, 100 ml eloquence, and take up a lot of space,\n\n","    um,\n\n","    however, and definitely, if you're going to ship these around, it can get costly to ship them. So that's another issue to consider.\n\n","    So\n\n","    I'll stop the second here. But, you know, consider the possibility of using multiple phages, Senior Center, but different parts of their center, right, avoid issues resistance, waiting a trade off. So what happens if you use all phage? targeting opsi? Right, that's really strong selection against the expression. So I would predict the deletion of this gene. Continued strong, strong, selective pressure. Best of luck to try your own. And maybe by the time you see this lecture, we'll have a couple of papers out showing the difference between cereal age and cocktails in the works\n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["cad46df2-4dbd-46d2-be8d-fcc4a18a4441"],"content":[{"id":"cad46df2-4dbd-46d2-be8d-fcc4a18a4441","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"bc9ac4cb-a3c1-446e-a524-794493aec2c2","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:01\n\n","    Okay, so to continue some lectures on phage therapy, again, my contact information is at the bottom if you feel the need to email or choppy instrument. so critical to phage therapy is actually age binding, it's really important biologically and may be a source of a lot of stages.

So it is or, as we said, you know, countless times during the series, incredibly specific, eight. And so part of that specificity, a pretty good chunk of it is due to just h 90 b being able to find material, not recognizing the appropriate receptor. So, you know, once it does find the appropriate receptor, it binds to it and then continues its its reproductive process, as we discussed in previous lectures, right. So specificity as is so complicated. And it means that material failure credibly host specific, and this is good or bad. Right?

However, now that we're appreciating the microbiome, and we're recognizing all these like collateral damage from some of these other antimicrobials, I think we're coming to appreciate the microbiome and its value to health. And so I think the specificity, specificity is actually quite good in that it allows for like a really personalized medicine. So let's consider the specificity here, or maybe here as a form of infection. Patient pressure, right? So in this cartoon, the left of a circle of the life cycle bacteria phage, right. So in a closed system, bacteria grow phage grow, they're going to be constantly infecting the bacteria. However, within the population of bacteria, mutation, will up or standing diversity might be sufficient if it's already present, so that the phage can no longer kill trade eight. So this evolved resistance so clear that evolved resistance to particular phage could be directed right, I'm saying can be directed to reduce a reverse antibiotic resistance or possibly attenuate virulence, I mean by that is, if we're careful in choosing what the bacteria phage is using as it binds to its bacterial host, could select for a phage that utilizes some component of bacterial virulence or antibiotic resistance, such that when the bacteria mutate away from phage, and become resistant to them, it comes at a cost by being increased, seemingly sensitive to antibiotics or maybe having more sorry, decreased virulence. Right? So this lower right, is just showing that it's a trade off between phage sensitivity and antibiotic resistance are very cool. So, you know, in theory, that's great. But what about in practice? I'm going to show a few examples here on how at least in the lab, we can, we can demonstrate this trade off. Okay.

And maybe by the time you see this lecture, we'll have a couple of papers out showing the difference between cereal age and cocktails in the works\n\n"]}]}]}},{"fields":{"Video Captions":["http://localhost:2024/api/notion/asset?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F1383f676-153b-4dc8-bf63-46416ebc425f%2Fben-chan-phage-therapy-3-480.vtt&blockId=c51e6ef3-5944-458f-8faa-5156e0b14ae3"],"AdminTags":["Comments"],"Status":"Published","URL":"class/phage-therapy-3","Slug":"phage-therapy-3","Video Cover":["http://localhost:2024/api/notion/asset?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F912392dd-b783-4df6-802c-c3c55011ba93%2Fben-chan-phage.therapy.jpg&blockId=c51e6ef3-5944-458f-8faa-5156e0b14ae3"],"Author":"ben-chan","Content ID":"Intro to Phages","Video Length":"41:09","Video":["http://localhost:2024/api/notion/asset?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F492819f4-8d6e-4521-928a-aaf60fb71a6e%2Fben-chan-phage-therapy-3-480.mp4&blockId=c51e6ef3-5944-458f-8faa-5156e0b14ae3"],"Video Size":"44.7 MB","Content Types":["Lecture"],"Name":"Phage Therapy: Cases (3 of 3)"},"orderedFields":[{"Name":"Phage Therapy: Cases (3 of 3)"},{"Status":"Published"},{"Content Types":["Lecture"]},{"Content ID":"Intro to Phages"},{"Author":"ben-chan"},{},{"Slug":"phage-therapy-3"},{},{"Video Cover":["http://localhost:2024/api/notion/asset?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F912392dd-b783-4df6-802c-c3c55011ba93%2Fben-chan-phage.therapy.jpg&blockId=c51e6ef3-5944-458f-8faa-5156e0b14ae3"]},{"Video":["http://localhost:2024/api/notion/asset?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F492819f4-8d6e-4521-928a-aaf60fb71a6e%2Fben-chan-phage-therapy-3-480.mp4&blockId=c51e6ef3-5944-458f-8faa-5156e0b14ae3"]},{"Video Size":"44.7 MB"},{"Video Length":"41:09"},{"Video Captions":["http://localhost:2024/api/notion/asset?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F1383f676-153b-4dc8-bf63-46416ebc425f%2Fben-chan-phage-therapy-3-480.vtt&blockId=c51e6ef3-5944-458f-8faa-5156e0b14ae3"]},{"URL":"class/phage-therapy-3"},{},{},{"AdminTags":["Comments"]}],"title":[["Phage Therapy: Cases (3 of 3)"]],"id":"c51e6ef3-5944-458f-8faa-5156e0b14ae3","created":1606155390616,"last_edited":1606164060000,"content":{"id":"c51e6ef3-5944-458f-8faa-5156e0b14ae3","type":"page","value":"Phage Therapy: Cases (3 of 3)","properties":{"FFx?":[["ben-chan-phage-therapy-3-480.vtt",[["a","https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1383f676-153b-4dc8-bf63-46416ebc425f/ben-chan-phage-therapy-3-480.vtt"]]]],"NB@k":[["Comments"]],"OMr<":[["Published"]],"Qt_p":[["class/phage-therapy-3"]],"[UIQ":[["phage-therapy-3"]],"jR?I":[["ben-chan-phage.therapy.jpg",[["a","https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/912392dd-b783-4df6-802c-c3c55011ba93/ben-chan-phage.therapy.jpg"]]]],"mwJJ":[["ben-chan"]],"oXfP":[["Intro to Phages"]],"se~C":[["41:09"]],"vTqO":[["ben-chan-phage-therapy-3-480.mp4",[["a","https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/492819f4-8d6e-4521-928a-aaf60fb71a6e/ben-chan-phage-therapy-3-480.mp4"]]]],"yNPq":[["44.7 MB"]],"|k=D":[["Lecture"]],"title":[["Phage Therapy: Cases (3 of 3)"]]},"parent_id":"936821a3-3ab9-43a3-bee6-931054a96e36","parent_table":"collection","markdown":["  <details>\n","    <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:01\n\n","    All right, so now let's talk about some of these cases. Right. And in order to get to the national cases, I thought we'd start off talking about\n\n","    involved.\n\n","    And just for, you know, example, we'll talk about Pseudomonas, because this is bacteria that said, spend\n\n","    So if you look at these effects, mumps and Pseudomonas called, most of them are Mac's, which that's multi response. And then they're named like max AB, okay, so that just has to deal with Max's multidrug efflux, and then a B would be the inner and transmembrane protein names. And then OPR is our membrane protein and then so other name so that they existed before chemical antibiotics were developed by humans, they, they do pump them out, and to pump out solvents, dyes, biocides cell signaling molecules, they're just great stuff. So no, factory, sorry, material kicks in and out of otic, but they recognize it.\n\n","    And of these six, four of them use the same outer membrane component OPR, as you can see here with this red letters,\n\n","    and these pumps, at least the OPR m gene is under stabilizing selection. This gentleman here in the lower left corner is named Mark sistrum. He works for me as an assistant professor at University of California, Merced said, and he analyzed genomes of all published Pseudomonas, specifically looking at remembering protein M. and found this under strong stabilizing selection, which means is highly conserved. So it's very similar in Pseudomonas, you pull from sewer versus UTI versus plant infection, all using the same OPR.\n\n","    And, you know, some of our earlier work showed that we tested a bunch of isolates from all over sewage, you know, infections, UTI, dog ear infections that were sensitive to the phage. And we tested the MRC. So that's the minimum inhibitory concentration of several antibiotics in three different groups broadly, those that efflux provides resistance, those that effects may provide resistance or provide some resistance, and then those three folks does not provide resistance. Right. So you'll see here in third column the MSE of\n\n","    these bacteria to these\n\n","    antibiotics. We then exposed it to phage on cat one and pulled resistant colonies from where we grew up those resistant bacteria tested MIT again and we got the following results right. So, we have a reduction of micc in the ones where effects provide resistance, big reduction, medium reduction in those where effects make fragile sense and no change where you know, existence okay. So, in several of these actually showed reversion from clinical resistance to susceptibility Alright, so, to confirm this receptor, and this is the this sort of work is stuff that you can do for like, all phages that just those using these, you know, remember, this, I mean, should probably do for all the phages discovery, you should at least know the receptor stability, its genomes, you know, all these things, right. So, just as an assembler determinant, we used a transpose on knockout we tense so basically a transposable element is inserted in, in the genes. So in this, we test it against one where transposons inserted in the atom every m gene. And we also tested this max R, which is the repressor of C flux system. So, for these e flux xenobiotics, the wild type is resistant, the knockout had a increased sensitivity. And then the repressor one is knocked out as a is still resistant, as you would expect. Something which is not a fluxed. That unchanged. We then tested face sensitivity and found that it was at the oprf knockout was resistant to facial hair culture sensitive,\n\n","    perfect strongly suggest that's the receptor. So we did this over time also with a reader. So the Y, I'm going to show you a plot here where the y axis is cell density as measured by od 600. And then time across the x eight, so when so should be color coordinated here. But you look at the wild type with ethos capable in the presence of subinhibitory\n\n","    Okay, so now let's jump way back to another section of lectures when I was talking about the very first case, right, so this is the case of the aortic aneurysm. We talked about that lectures ago. I told you we get back to it. Now the point we're getting back to\n\n","    Getting reagents that grew up resistant to the phage and we tested the MRC again, and we saw a big decrease in Cipro, gentamicin tobramycin. And also some testing. As we saw a general improvement in bio sensitivities of black bars in Cipro, gentamicin and Bryson represent clinical breakpoints for these drugs. So what we saw is reversion from clinical resistance to sensitivity to these drugs, simply by involves page resistance.\n\n","    So I took the data to the surgeons and they were like, awesome, this is what we need to do. Let's treat this guy, right. So you know if you're going to develop a therapy, this is like basic identifying like you have it's therapy. You sample you tested sensitivity of the bacteria isolate seven\n\n","    strains ideally, in a well characterized library, grow up the phage, concentrate, phage endotoxin, and EXO toxins dialyze it, you know, contaminants, prepare to doses and then confirm the low endotoxin concentration, and then you should be ready to go. Right. So I realized I say it like it's some simple tasks, means one of the steps requires a lot of work. But it's certainly something can be done in most labs.\n\n","    Well, that was not possible. So we tried doing this for three hours in the theater, and we were unable to puncture this, this little collection of fluid, do heavy scarring. So you know, it like obsessed and like, walled off, and it was scarring.\n\n","    So we did that and discharged him four weeks post procedure, he developed a bunch of bleeding from that fistula, and, you know, very concerning, right, because you're like, Oh, my God, the,\n\n","    because of this illness, where the physicians there, identify that pinkeye, pseudocyst and drain so they saw these little systems as they drained them, and they pulled us into the vector bahmani. Right. So they stabilized in there with some antibiotics. And then they flew him to California for treatment. And by time he ended up in California, this bug was actually Pandora resistant, which means is resistant to the available chemical antibiotics.\n\n","    So this point, they started working on a potential phage treatment. And they just were administered for eight weeks, I believe, 16 weeks, sorry, 16 weeks via washing the abscess areas and by IP. Let me see what goes on there. What they gave.\n\n","    They were also this guy was also given several endo biotics via IV vancomycin meropenem cost into cycling. And they also added azithromycin on day 36 of his treatment. This is combination of work between several groups went to Texas, the Navy, California\n\n","    And the bottom blue line, there is the duration of IV therapy with phage. Right, and the pots on the right are growth charts similar to the one I showed you previously.\n\n","    It's similar to this right, so similar optical density over time, this is using a proprietary technology by one of the authors on the paper, that is functionally the equivalent\n\n","    So with this case, they also were able to pull blood samples because the guy was admitted in hospital. So it's pretty straightforward, the easy blood. And they found that faders were actually readily removed from serum. So you know, they took control minus five minutes, five minutes, 30 minutes, 6183 60. And then they pulled blood, and they quantified age. And they found you know, before face every there's no age, see, in five minutes, they had one point 10 fourth pfds per mil,\n\n","    by 30 minutes, it was down to four times in a third an hour, it was almost undetectable, and one. So within an hour they're gone from. And also importantly, is that serum collected at the end of the study showed neutralizing antibodies. So they basically found that the antibody immune system had recognized the phages in the cocktail and would kill them. So this is by the end of the study. I don't know if it determined the point at which this happened. But by 16 weeks, it was resistant. By day eight, the blood cultures were all resistant to the phages test as far as I understand. But they continued using IV phage. In case there was some there were still sensitive. Following 16 weeks of fake treatment, including a six week coma, he just woke up one day. And he's been working ever since he looks great. He's out talking. You can Google him, he's he's a very nice guy. And you can read all about it, hear all about it on YouTube, with his wife on the left, she's written a book about it. And you can find this on Google. And so that's that's the case in California. So after that case, we ended up creating quite a few pulmonary cases. So because of a press from that case, and in our prior one, we started getting contacted by a bunch of individuals or physicians with cases that they were treating or their sub selves and family members with infections that they were looking for alternatives because the cases I'm about to tell you are, are of those flavors. This one we'll call case was a young woman with cystic fibrosis. So it's a genetic disease that results in, you know, thick mucus production, and they are prone to pulmonary infections. So in this case, right here, this woman had chronic pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa that's, you know, that's a very, very common bacteria in cystic fibrosis, okay. So she historically had a baseline febe one, which is the forced expiratory volume of air that individuals breathe out at one second\n\n","    of 90%. So that just means that she had 90% lung function of someone without CF of her age and sex. Okay. So this was how up until 2015, she had this 90 or greater, right so then from 2015 to 2017. She was stable in the 80s with a slight decline and then it went In 17, she was sent to an adult CF center. So she's transitioning into adult care where they gave her some IV antibiotics to increase trying to increase her pulmonary function. And so these lung infections are rough, right? Because they basically, in the airways, they get an infection, which causes inflammation and tissue damage, which damages the circulation and allows the infection to get bigger. And so basically, it's a progressive disease where it feeds back on itself, in part because a lot of these virulence factors that are secreted so I'm going to show you a plot of this young woman's, if he wants to help as a proxy for lung function, okay, so she got this iv causton, here in the in January 2017, that she's in the skill center.\n\n","    And then it dipped a little bit. She had a little exacerbation and went down, but she got more IVs. And then it recovered. Right, so this gray bar here is when she's in the hospital.\n\n","    So she got hospitalized the gave her iv causton. She's great. He started declining in when she got out. So as I need to gave her more IV antibiotics, here's a triple combo. So they gave her that during a hospitalization and almost immediately she presented with australium. With CF, okay, that's very common, when you deplete someone's microbiome with all these antibiotics, a lot of times see this, which cause further problems. And then such a partial lung collapse here. Then once she was discharged, she's gradually was improving. So then in October, she had 14 days of IV antibiotics, her lung function continued to decline. And as at this point, that they contacted us about phage because of the resistance profile, and the fact that antibiotics didn't seem to work. So if you look at the section right here, blowing up a little bit, okay, so they pulled back here from her speed. And so she coughed up. And they cultured bacteria out of it, and they quantified it as for us, so these are semi quantitative method, they found more, so that's a very heavy infection. They call to the bacteria and to be resistant all these antibiotics, right? It treated with iv causton and tezo. continued to decline. You can see it was continuing to be resistant. They finished antibiotics and her lung function still was going down, suggesting that it wasn't doing any, hey, we initiated phage therapy right here, it's not a sample of bacteria. So, we had received bacteria for sputum. And I wrote it in a biofilm to test it. So I equate this bacteria in a biofilm and then I treated with either phage H plus antibiotic and aquatic alone just to control I let it sit for 24 hours and I sonicated it out for the bacteria right. So I found that phage alone decreased one order of magnitude bacteria, H plus antibiotic two orders of magnitude and then antibiotic and the control identical, okay, so it helps it doesn't look much on the plot here because a log scale right? But it did kill 90% of the bacteria within 24 hours, okay. So it degraded some biofilm. Alright, so below that is a plot of the MSE of the surviving bacteria. And we found that in the cases where it was exposed to phage at all, it had a seriously decreased micc to about it was even pregnant is that for my son? So this bacteriophage can help degrade biofilms and improve the antibiotic sensitivity of Pseudomonas isolates and clinical isolates too. So, um, so we tested this is I just talked about this, but we saw two orders of magnitude reduction with H plus exposure and then a reduction in antibiotic resistance as well.\n\n","    Right, so we started as I said, Here, we started phage therapy a week, and then we called your battery out and we found increased increased sensitivity so Cipro now intermediate resistance level foxes in intermediate capacity, 17, tezo, and imipenem. It's sensitive. So we've opened up several antibiotics that we can use to treat a chicken came back a couple months, cultured again, sensitive to almost all these antibiotics, also know her lung function once we initiated phage therapy, her lung full jumped up 10% and then it continued to increase back to 80. Okay. So she had a bunch of, you know, responses, she had an increase in nuke split production. She lost her car, she had a little bit of a eight week after he had all this increased energy joined the gym, lung, sun and clear. However, her lungs continue to produce Pseudomonas as you expect them individually, CF. Healthcare is no longer drug resistant. It's been geez almost three years now and her FPV is actually above 90%. Now, she said zero exacerbation sense. So it's kept her in the hospital for years with this great lung function. So it's entirely possible fH really have a strong role here. And so from this case, things went really crazy. And people were all over contacting us about treatment, especially for pulmonary function. So pulmonary infections, specially those with CF. Okay, so she, you know, I often get asked, Oh, is it trade off a replacement because a lot of these lungs, especially cystic fibrosis, it's a really complicated community of many strains of Pseudomonas and other bacteria. And so the question is, often did you just kill the drug resistant ones? And then the drug sensitive ones grew up? Or were you causing some evolution happening inside the lungs? I think it's both actually. The original sputum had multiple phenotypes. Unsurprisingly, unsurprising. But by the end, it was basically a single isolate single strain. However, that's a replacement, strong suggestive of a replacement. However, in the lab, when I take these strains and expose them to phage, I can see a change in MSE to tobramycin. Also, so there's an improvement in sensitivities due to selection. So it's probably both there's a trade off happening as of evolution and lung. There's also a placement of by these less resistant strains are allowed to grow up with the niches opened up. So yeah, now we're way out there, she's got a really high ABV no hospitalizations, notes, so patients, um, so she's doing great. And she's, she's also been in the press quite a bit. She's, she's great, we still hang out there, and we're in touch pretty frequently. And so definitely read up on her case, if you're interested. There's a lot online. Her name is Paige Rogers, so you can watch it below documentaries about her. Um, and so so that really got people excited in the possibility of treating CF infections with with age. Um, so there are several other cases we treated. But after this owner infection that we treated, we basically set up the fH center. I thought I'd take a few minutes here and talk about the H Center. So we have a basic treatment algorithm where we you know, we have people coming in from all across the country or obviously, within Yale health system. With infection treated, we basically identified bacteria in Canada, phage. Syria, we select phage. In device treatment plants, we do an ultra personalized approach, we were very specific on what phages we use and for how long based on lab data, we're doing actual science, where we say, oh, use this page for four days, and then this one for three, and then this combination for another four days, and you have the highest likelihood of doing the bacteria reducing resistance and increasing sensitivity. Or maybe we're targeting virulence to all these things, we select the agent\n\n","    that we deploy the phage, right, so we have them all prepared in in a medically appropriate way. And they're pure enough to be used therapeutically. We treat the individuals and then we monitor changes, right? So a lot of these case reports, they're not doing science, but there's throwing the phage and they're saying, Oh, they got better. It was the page. We're actually monitoring changes. Okay. We have microbiome data for all these lung samples, we're looking at clinical changes in terms of lung function, we're looking at immune response, we're looking at evolution within the lung, we're looking at evolution within the wounds, we're looking at changes in terms of age sensitivity, we're looking at changes in antibiotic sensitivity, obviously, we're looking at changes in the production of these virulence factors during all this, so we really, really well what each page is doing inside the body. Okay. So, when we're selecting phage, we grew up the bacteria, right? And you turn it sensitivity, as I just said, in large Linux spectrums. We talked about this, maybe a few lectures back about determining a sensitivity on it, and then we select the appropriate range. So we have a big library phages at Yale, you know, in the thousands, when and we basically I isolate them constantly from all over the world and we select phages will make all of them but we select pages with relevant clinical and clinically meaning over sectors, right? You're trying to find phages that would make good therapy candidates because not all phages Well, even if phage kills bacteria really well, it might not be a good therapeutic candidate actually increased drug resistance, increase variance, we have to be very careful that we do this properly, or else we can cause disease towards a so we looking at this page for clinically clinically meaningful receptors, for example, antibody, efflux motility, virulence factor production, right? So, for example, let's just look at this page. We talked about a previously made targets antibiotic efflux, right? So you grew up bacteria. Supposing the phage, right, and then you've sequenced the bacteria to come out, and you quantify the number of mutate mutations that occur along the genome. You say, Ah, this guy has a bunch of mutations in efflux. Awesome, it did its job. We have another phage that targets tech for us, which is for motility. involved in motility and some virulence factor production. Actually, you do the same thing grew up the bacteria, explosive phage, select resistant mutants sequence those guys, you see a bunch of mutations in four pillars, exactly as you'd expect.\n\n","    The same thing for trying to reduce inflammation and maybe work synergistically with immune system, we might target the entity, right, so we do the same thing as the previous study. And these mutations are in LPs. Right now we have these three really good pages that we use therapeutically. So let's make a cocktail out of them. Right? Let's just take these three targets, three different virulence factors, pull them together, make a cocktail.\n\n","    The same thing is a cocktail growed up. If the resistant mutants, what do you see?\n\n","    Ah, it's not mutations in anabolic effects pills and MPs, as mutations in the capsule and mismatch repair is exactly what we didn't want. Resistant mutants in this case, are harder to kill by white blood cells, they have increased antibiotic resistance and increased chance of invading new tissues, this is gonna make the disease much worse using this cocktail, right. So what happens if we do it in series? This is my case for serial MonaVie therapy. You are the first page targets and resistant mutants that come out of all these mutations in flux, right? Take the strain, expose it to the next page. Boom, see the mutations in the pelisse. Right, hit it with the last page, we see all the changes in LPs surviving population now has decreased antibiotic resistance, decreased virulence and decreased ability to invade new niches and tissues and increased consumption by white blood cells. Right? So this can work synergistically with the immune system. Obviously, we're not always in a privileged position to to come up with a page cocktail and treat them see. Sorry, come on phages treat in series like this, for all cases, this works in chronic infections with high likelihood of recon ization or reinfection, right? If it's an acute and pen resistant infection that's very severe, you might not have the liberty to do this. And so just throw the cocktail at it, kill off a bunch of bacteria, control inflammation, come back with a new cocktail because your library should have hundreds of different foods, you can always find a new cocktail to use in series.\n\n","    So using this approach of serial monitor phage therapy, I'll talk about few other cases here. Right so this is a 16 year old girl with cystic fibrosis and has lung disease or pulmonary function. And she was experiencing it's pretty severe exacerbation. How does isn't Pseudomonas intervene with phage. Here again, pre and post junk sensitivities are here in the table on the left pod is the same as before and FPV one, so she started off with much lower lung function with some mild increase. But we did see a very rapid reduction of speed of bacteria density, two orders of magnitude reduced. And she returned to her baseline, C reactive protein and white blood cells after a week so suggesting that the phage intervention had helped with inflammation. Alright, so a couple more cases here so we treated a 26 year old woman with CF Same as before and resistance to monus. In her case, we were looking for a way that we can be open sensitivity to meropenem. So treated her here. You can see this plot is the green line is when based therapies and used in the pre therapy so I've had the privilege of getting sputum before treatment. quantified bacteria didn't see a change in speed and density. We asked phage and immediately saw a big reduction of Pseudomonas. In this case, it looks like nearly three orders of magnitude. And then the bacteria that grew out of that were sensitive to meropenem again, so she was able to get out of hospital. She's also been in the media quite a bit. My name's Ella. You can Google Ella Lhasa, and you'll see all about her story. But she actually stayed out of the hospital for quite a while with this benefit from page, all right case, blow this is an elderly gentleman with COPD and a massive lung abscess requiring surgical intervention. But the surgeons wouldn't touch the case because, you know, massive abscess and there was a big risk of opening them up the infection spread. So they had retweeted this guy with phage. And we have a pre age density of 10 to the six PS CFS per mil, we treated with the only antibiotic was sensitive to and actually, on the day we treated with phage. It was toward the end of that course of antibiotics and his bacterial load actually had gone up two orders of magnitude. We started with phage and immediately saw a big reduction in bacteria density, almost four orders of magnitude and re sensitization that America and he saw some improvement on imaging to the point where surgeons would once again consider the case for removal of abscess.\n\n","    Okay, just a couple more quick ones here with another non CF bronchiectasis this man was injured in a house fire with a lot of smoke 40 years ago, and then had a chronic lung lung infections ever since because a lung tissue was damaged. So his Pseudomonas was resistant to every chemical on ionic, even those in trials. And so he came to us about age, which he did this individual ice. So the first case here on the applaud this the first green section, we saw a big reduction of\n\n","    speed of density and bacteria, three orders of magnitude reduction.\n\n","    And then we treated him again a couple months later, and we saw another reduction of bacteria to the point of where it's below limit detection by the lab and this was a 16 year infection that is eradicated it's important to say that you see the two cultures here on the left. Um, that's the color of the bacteria before treatment and after treatment CCNA reduction of the production of Prasanna which is which is one of virulence factors talked about earlier in this lecture. So we actually made a prediction in the lab of what would happen, I created a visual saw what happened on the on the on the back end of that and actually matched our prediction. Okay, k seven down here is a 38 year old woman with CF. panners isn't Pseudomonas. Again, same stories before we treated with phage targeting pls, which was involved in Prasanna production, we saw an immediate reduction, two orders of magnitude reduction speed and density bacteria. And then we saw an improvement to separate floxin. So she could use that again, and a little bit of an improvement in FPV. One, you see the plates below here are actually agency sensitivity plates we took to some of our top phages. before, during and after phage therapy so the top is before things or screen during therapy is less screen and then after that, if you see three strains that we pulled that were completely devoid, so it's exactly as we would have predicted would have happened.\n\n","    Okay, so just some quick conclusions about this. This least with the with the work we're doing at Yale is that face can force clinically meaningful trade offs in vitro. Okay, lab essays can inform clinical decisions, especially regarding environment selection, we can work with clinicians to identify which pages will work best with certain antibiotics to optimize treatment, okay. Next bring phage treatment, they can be deployed safely and effectively seen zero severe adverse events, no bronchospasm nothing. And they can be deployed effectively to treat these infections, changes in bacterial community during phage therapy can be potentially predicted based on lab essays and CNN with inflammation with drug flux, we can make a prediction and it looks like it works to people. Okay. So, terms of outcome, clinically, clinically meaningful trade offs can be forced in vivo, right? So we can cause bacteria to be drug sensitive again, and cause them to stop producing some of these virulence factors. Okay, so changes in status, therefore, like in terms of improvement, maybe improve lung function, health can be attributed to a phage based intervention. However, in the absence of placebo controlled clinical trials, we can't definitively make that claim. We have a clinical trial that by the time this airs We started, we received permission from FDA to start, we're just finishing manufacturing today. That trial world isn't cystic fibrosis, we're going to work there. And we have two trials planned every year after that. And we're going to be working in different bacteria, different diseases. But until we get these clinical trials up and running, we can't make any claims. So this is where I would normally take questions. However, I obviously can't message me, but you can through email. It's been like every one of my lectures, or Instagram. This is a picture of some of the people in the lab, and then a Venn diagram of a center Gail, where we involve education of med students, grad students, clinical lab scientists, doing actual scientific research on the medical side, clinical trial research, we're doing bench science, and then we're actually doing clinical trials and clinical research. So with that, I think I'm gonna jump to some other\n\n","    topics at another time. But again, if you have any questions, feel free to email me and pretty quickly replying\n\n","    \n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["73287f3c-b49a-4300-9030-49985548978b"],"content":[{"id":"73287f3c-b49a-4300-9030-49985548978b","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"c51e6ef3-5944-458f-8faa-5156e0b14ae3","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Ben Chan 0:01\n\n","    All right, so now let's talk about some of these cases. Right. And in order to get to the national cases, I thought we'd start off talking about\n\n","    involved.\n\n","    And just for, you know, example, we'll talk about Pseudomonas, because this is bacteria that said, spend\n\n","    So if you look at these effects, mumps and Pseudomonas called, most of them are Mac's, which that's multi response. And then they're named like max AB, okay, so that just has to deal with Max's multidrug efflux, and then a B would be the inner and transmembrane protein names. And then OPR is our membrane protein and then so other name so that they existed before chemical antibiotics were developed by humans, they, they do pump them out, and to pump out solvents, dyes, biocides cell signaling molecules, they're just great stuff. So no, factory, sorry, material kicks in and out of otic, but they recognize it.\n\n","    And of these six, four of them use the same outer membrane component OPR, as you can see here with this red letters,\n\n","    and these pumps, at least the OPR m gene is under stabilizing selection. This gentleman here in the lower left corner is named Mark sistrum. He works for me as an assistant professor at University of California, Merced said, and he analyzed genomes of all published Pseudomonas, specifically looking at remembering protein M. and found this under strong stabilizing selection, which means is highly conserved. So it's very similar in Pseudomonas, you pull from sewer versus UTI versus plant infection, all using the same OPR.\n\n","    And, you know, some of our earlier work showed that we tested a bunch of isolates from all over sewage, you know, infections, UTI, dog ear infections that were sensitive to the phage. And we tested the MRC. So that's the minimum inhibitory concentration of several antibiotics in three different groups broadly, those that efflux provides resistance, those that effects may provide resistance or provide some resistance, and then those three folks does not provide resistance. Right. So you'll see here in third column the MSE of\n\n","    these bacteria to these\n\n","    antibiotics. We then exposed it to phage on cat one and pulled resistant colonies from where we grew up those resistant bacteria tested MIT again and we got the following results right. So, we have a reduction of micc in the ones where effects provide resistance, big reduction, medium reduction in those where effects make fragile sense and no change where you know, existence okay. So, in several of these actually showed reversion from clinical resistance to susceptibility Alright, so, to confirm this receptor, and this is the this sort of work is stuff that you can do for like, all phages that just those using these, you know, remember, this, I mean, should probably do for all the phages discovery, you should at least know the receptor stability, its genomes, you know, all these things, right. So, just as an assembler determinant, we used a transpose on knockout we tense so basically a transposable element is inserted in, in the genes. So in this, we test it against one where transposons inserted in the atom every m gene. And we also tested this max R, which is the repressor of C flux system. So, for these e flux xenobiotics, the wild type is resistant, the knockout had a increased sensitivity. And then the repressor one is knocked out as a is still resistant, as you would expect. Something which is not a fluxed. That unchanged. We then tested face sensitivity and found that it was at the oprf knockout was resistant to facial hair culture sensitive,\n\n","    perfect strongly suggest that's the receptor. So we did this over time also with a reader. So the Y, I'm going to show you a plot here where the y axis is cell density as measured by od 600. And then time across the x eight, so when so should be color coordinated here. But you look at the wild type with ethos capable in the presence of subinhibitory\n\n","    Okay, so now let's jump way back to another section of lectures when I was talking about the very first case, right, so this is the case of the aortic aneurysm. We talked about that lectures ago. I told you we get back to it. Now the point we're getting back to\n\n","    Getting reagents that grew up resistant to the phage and we tested the MRC again, and we saw a big decrease in Cipro, gentamicin tobramycin. And also some testing. As we saw a general improvement in bio sensitivities of black bars in Cipro, gentamicin and Bryson represent clinical breakpoints for these drugs. So what we saw is reversion from clinical resistance to sensitivity to these drugs, simply by involves page resistance.\n\n","    So I took the data to the surgeons and they were like, awesome, this is what we need to do. Let's treat this guy, right. So you know if you're going to develop a therapy, this is like basic identifying like you have it's therapy. You sample you tested sensitivity of the bacteria isolate seven\n\n","    strains ideally, in a well characterized library, grow up the phage, concentrate, phage endotoxin, and EXO toxins dialyze it, you know, contaminants, prepare to doses and then confirm the low endotoxin concentration, and then you should be ready to go. Right. So I realized I say it like it's some simple tasks, means one of the steps requires a lot of work. But it's certainly something can be done in most labs.\n\n","    Well, that was not possible. So we tried doing this for three hours in the theater, and we were unable to puncture this, this little collection of fluid, do heavy scarring. So you know, it like obsessed and like, walled off, and it was scarring.\n\n","    So we did that and discharged him four weeks post procedure, he developed a bunch of bleeding from that fistula, and, you know, very concerning, right, because you're like, Oh, my God, the,\n\n","    because of this illness, where the physicians there, identify that pinkeye, pseudocyst and drain so they saw these little systems as they drained them, and they pulled us into the vector bahmani. Right. So they stabilized in there with some antibiotics. And then they flew him to California for treatment. And by time he ended up in California, this bug was actually Pandora resistant, which means is resistant to the available chemical antibiotics.\n\n","    So this point, they started working on a potential phage treatment. And they just were administered for eight weeks, I believe, 16 weeks, sorry, 16 weeks via washing the abscess areas and by IP. Let me see what goes on there. What they gave.\n\n","    They were also this guy was also given several endo biotics via IV vancomycin meropenem cost into cycling. And they also added azithromycin on day 36 of his treatment. This is combination of work between several groups went to Texas, the Navy, California\n\n","    And the bottom blue line, there is the duration of IV therapy with phage. Right, and the pots on the right are growth charts similar to the one I showed you previously.\n\n","    It's similar to this right, so similar optical density over time, this is using a proprietary technology by one of the authors on the paper, that is functionally the equivalent\n\n","    So with this case, they also were able to pull blood samples because the guy was admitted in hospital. So it's pretty straightforward, the easy blood. And they found that faders were actually readily removed from serum. So you know, they took control minus five minutes, five minutes, 30 minutes, 6183 60. And then they pulled blood, and they quantified age. And they found you know, before face every there's no age, see, in five minutes, they had one point 10 fourth pfds per mil,\n\n","    by 30 minutes, it was down to four times in a third an hour, it was almost undetectable, and one. So within an hour they're gone from. And also importantly, is that serum collected at the end of the study showed neutralizing antibodies. So they basically found that the antibody immune system had recognized the phages in the cocktail and would kill them. So this is by the end of the study. I don't know if it determined the point at which this happened. But by 16 weeks, it was resistant. By day eight, the blood cultures were all resistant to the phages test as far as I understand. But they continued using IV phage. In case there was some there were still sensitive. Following 16 weeks of fake treatment, including a six week coma, he just woke up one day. And he's been working ever since he looks great. He's out talking. You can Google him, he's he's a very nice guy. And you can read all about it, hear all about it on YouTube, with his wife on the left, she's written a book about it. And you can find this on Google. And so that's that's the case in California. So after that case, we ended up creating quite a few pulmonary cases. So because of a press from that case, and in our prior one, we started getting contacted by a bunch of individuals or physicians with cases that they were treating or their sub selves and family members with infections that they were looking for alternatives because the cases I'm about to tell you are, are of those flavors. This one we'll call case was a young woman with cystic fibrosis. So it's a genetic disease that results in, you know, thick mucus production, and they are prone to pulmonary infections. So in this case, right here, this woman had chronic pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa that's, you know, that's a very, very common bacteria in cystic fibrosis, okay. So she historically had a baseline febe one, which is the forced expiratory volume of air that individuals breathe out at one second\n\n","    of 90%. So that just means that she had 90% lung function of someone without CF of her age and sex. Okay. So this was how up until 2015, she had this 90 or greater, right so then from 2015 to 2017. She was stable in the 80s with a slight decline and then it went In 17, she was sent to an adult CF center. So she's transitioning into adult care where they gave her some IV antibiotics to increase trying to increase her pulmonary function. And so these lung infections are rough, right? Because they basically, in the airways, they get an infection, which causes inflammation and tissue damage, which damages the circulation and allows the infection to get bigger. And so basically, it's a progressive disease where it feeds back on itself, in part because a lot of these virulence factors that are secreted so I'm going to show you a plot of this young woman's, if he wants to help as a proxy for lung function, okay, so she got this iv causton, here in the in January 2017, that she's in the skill center.\n\n","    And then it dipped a little bit. She had a little exacerbation and went down, but she got more IVs. And then it recovered. Right, so this gray bar here is when she's in the hospital.\n\n","    So she got hospitalized the gave her iv causton. She's great. He started declining in when she got out. So as I need to gave her more IV antibiotics, here's a triple combo. So they gave her that during a hospitalization and almost immediately she presented with australium. With CF, okay, that's very common, when you deplete someone's microbiome with all these antibiotics, a lot of times see this, which cause further problems. And then such a partial lung collapse here. Then once she was discharged, she's gradually was improving. So then in October, she had 14 days of IV antibiotics, her lung function continued to decline. And as at this point, that they contacted us about phage because of the resistance profile, and the fact that antibiotics didn't seem to work. So if you look at the section right here, blowing up a little bit, okay, so they pulled back here from her speed. And so she coughed up. And they cultured bacteria out of it, and they quantified it as for us, so these are semi quantitative method, they found more, so that's a very heavy infection. They call to the bacteria and to be resistant all these antibiotics, right? It treated with iv causton and tezo. continued to decline. You can see it was continuing to be resistant. They finished antibiotics and her lung function still was going down, suggesting that it wasn't doing any, hey, we initiated phage therapy right here, it's not a sample of bacteria. So, we had received bacteria for sputum. And I wrote it in a biofilm to test it. So I equate this bacteria in a biofilm and then I treated with either phage H plus antibiotic and aquatic alone just to control I let it sit for 24 hours and I sonicated it out for the bacteria right. So I found that phage alone decreased one order of magnitude bacteria, H plus antibiotic two orders of magnitude and then antibiotic and the control identical, okay, so it helps it doesn't look much on the plot here because a log scale right? But it did kill 90% of the bacteria within 24 hours, okay. So it degraded some biofilm. Alright, so below that is a plot of the MSE of the surviving bacteria. And we found that in the cases where it was exposed to phage at all, it had a seriously decreased micc to about it was even pregnant is that for my son? So this bacteriophage can help degrade biofilms and improve the antibiotic sensitivity of Pseudomonas isolates and clinical isolates too. So, um, so we tested this is I just talked about this, but we saw two orders of magnitude reduction with H plus exposure and then a reduction in antibiotic resistance as well.\n\n","    Right, so we started as I said, Here, we started phage therapy a week, and then we called your battery out and we found increased increased sensitivity so Cipro now intermediate resistance level foxes in intermediate capacity, 17, tezo, and imipenem. It's sensitive. So we've opened up several antibiotics that we can use to treat a chicken came back a couple months, cultured again, sensitive to almost all these antibiotics, also know her lung function once we initiated phage therapy, her lung full jumped up 10% and then it continued to increase back to 80. Okay. So she had a bunch of, you know, responses, she had an increase in nuke split production. She lost her car, she had a little bit of a eight week after he had all this increased energy joined the gym, lung, sun and clear. However, her lungs continue to produce Pseudomonas as you expect them individually, CF. Healthcare is no longer drug resistant. It's been geez almost three years now and her FPV is actually above 90%. Now, she said zero exacerbation sense. So it's kept her in the hospital for years with this great lung function. So it's entirely possible fH really have a strong role here. And so from this case, things went really crazy. And people were all over contacting us about treatment, especially for pulmonary function. So pulmonary infections, specially those with CF. Okay, so she, you know, I often get asked, Oh, is it trade off a replacement because a lot of these lungs, especially cystic fibrosis, it's a really complicated community of many strains of Pseudomonas and other bacteria. And so the question is, often did you just kill the drug resistant ones? And then the drug sensitive ones grew up? Or were you causing some evolution happening inside the lungs? I think it's both actually. The original sputum had multiple phenotypes. Unsurprisingly, unsurprising. But by the end, it was basically a single isolate single strain. However, that's a replacement, strong suggestive of a replacement. However, in the lab, when I take these strains and expose them to phage, I can see a change in MSE to tobramycin. Also, so there's an improvement in sensitivities due to selection. So it's probably both there's a trade off happening as of evolution and lung. There's also a placement of by these less resistant strains are allowed to grow up with the niches opened up. So yeah, now we're way out there, she's got a really high ABV no hospitalizations, notes, so patients, um, so she's doing great. And she's, she's also been in the press quite a bit. She's, she's great, we still hang out there, and we're in touch pretty frequently. And so definitely read up on her case, if you're interested. There's a lot online. Her name is Paige Rogers, so you can watch it below documentaries about her. Um, and so so that really got people excited in the possibility of treating CF infections with with age. Um, so there are several other cases we treated. But after this owner infection that we treated, we basically set up the fH center. I thought I'd take a few minutes here and talk about the H Center. So we have a basic treatment algorithm where we you know, we have people coming in from all across the country or obviously, within Yale health system. With infection treated, we basically identified bacteria in Canada, phage. Syria, we select phage. In device treatment plants, we do an ultra personalized approach, we were very specific on what phages we use and for how long based on lab data, we're doing actual science, where we say, oh, use this page for four days, and then this one for three, and then this combination for another four days, and you have the highest likelihood of doing the bacteria reducing resistance and increasing sensitivity. Or maybe we're targeting virulence to all these things, we select the agent\n\n","    that we deploy the phage, right, so we have them all prepared in in a medically appropriate way. And they're pure enough to be used therapeutically. We treat the individuals and then we monitor changes, right? So a lot of these case reports, they're not doing science, but there's throwing the phage and they're saying, Oh, they got better. It was the page. We're actually monitoring changes. Okay. We have microbiome data for all these lung samples, we're looking at clinical changes in terms of lung function, we're looking at immune response, we're looking at evolution within the lung, we're looking at evolution within the wounds, we're looking at changes in terms of age sensitivity, we're looking at changes in antibiotic sensitivity, obviously, we're looking at changes in the production of these virulence factors during all this, so we really, really well what each page is doing inside the body. Okay. So, when we're selecting phage, we grew up the bacteria, right? And you turn it sensitivity, as I just said, in large Linux spectrums. We talked about this, maybe a few lectures back about determining a sensitivity on it, and then we select the appropriate range. So we have a big library phages at Yale, you know, in the thousands, when and we basically I isolate them constantly from all over the world and we select phages will make all of them but we select pages with relevant clinical and clinically meaning over sectors, right? You're trying to find phages that would make good therapy candidates because not all phages Well, even if phage kills bacteria really well, it might not be a good therapeutic candidate actually increased drug resistance, increase variance, we have to be very careful that we do this properly, or else we can cause disease towards a so we looking at this page for clinically clinically meaningful receptors, for example, antibody, efflux motility, virulence factor production, right? So, for example, let's just look at this page. We talked about a previously made targets antibiotic efflux, right? So you grew up bacteria. Supposing the phage, right, and then you've sequenced the bacteria to come out, and you quantify the number of mutate mutations that occur along the genome. You say, Ah, this guy has a bunch of mutations in efflux. Awesome, it did its job. We have another phage that targets tech for us, which is for motility. involved in motility and some virulence factor production. Actually, you do the same thing grew up the bacteria, explosive phage, select resistant mutants sequence those guys, you see a bunch of mutations in four pillars, exactly as you'd expect.\n\n","    The same thing for trying to reduce inflammation and maybe work synergistically with immune system, we might target the entity, right, so we do the same thing as the previous study. And these mutations are in LPs. Right now we have these three really good pages that we use therapeutically. So let's make a cocktail out of them. Right? Let's just take these three targets, three different virulence factors, pull them together, make a cocktail.\n\n","    The same thing is a cocktail growed up. If the resistant mutants, what do you see?\n\n","    Ah, it's not mutations in anabolic effects pills and MPs, as mutations in the capsule and mismatch repair is exactly what we didn't want. Resistant mutants in this case, are harder to kill by white blood cells, they have increased antibiotic resistance and increased chance of invading new tissues, this is gonna make the disease much worse using this cocktail, right. So what happens if we do it in series? This is my case for serial MonaVie therapy. You are the first page targets and resistant mutants that come out of all these mutations in flux, right? Take the strain, expose it to the next page. Boom, see the mutations in the pelisse. Right, hit it with the last page, we see all the changes in LPs surviving population now has decreased antibiotic resistance, decreased virulence and decreased ability to invade new niches and tissues and increased consumption by white blood cells. Right? So this can work synergistically with the immune system. Obviously, we're not always in a privileged position to to come up with a page cocktail and treat them see. Sorry, come on phages treat in series like this, for all cases, this works in chronic infections with high likelihood of recon ization or reinfection, right? If it's an acute and pen resistant infection that's very severe, you might not have the liberty to do this. And so just throw the cocktail at it, kill off a bunch of bacteria, control inflammation, come back with a new cocktail because your library should have hundreds of different foods, you can always find a new cocktail to use in series.\n\n","    So using this approach of serial monitor phage therapy, I'll talk about few other cases here. Right so this is a 16 year old girl with cystic fibrosis and has lung disease or pulmonary function. And she was experiencing it's pretty severe exacerbation. How does isn't Pseudomonas intervene with phage. Here again, pre and post junk sensitivities are here in the table on the left pod is the same as before and FPV one, so she started off with much lower lung function with some mild increase. But we did see a very rapid reduction of speed of bacteria density, two orders of magnitude reduced. And she returned to her baseline, C reactive protein and white blood cells after a week so suggesting that the phage intervention had helped with inflammation. Alright, so a couple more cases here so we treated a 26 year old woman with CF Same as before and resistance to monus. In her case, we were looking for a way that we can be open sensitivity to meropenem. So treated her here. You can see this plot is the green line is when based therapies and used in the pre therapy so I've had the privilege of getting sputum before treatment. quantified bacteria didn't see a change in speed and density. We asked phage and immediately saw a big reduction of Pseudomonas. In this case, it looks like nearly three orders of magnitude. And then the bacteria that grew out of that were sensitive to meropenem again, so she was able to get out of hospital. She's also been in the media quite a bit. My name's Ella. You can Google Ella Lhasa, and you'll see all about her story. But she actually stayed out of the hospital for quite a while with this benefit from page, all right case, blow this is an elderly gentleman with COPD and a massive lung abscess requiring surgical intervention. But the surgeons wouldn't touch the case because, you know, massive abscess and there was a big risk of opening them up the infection spread. So they had retweeted this guy with phage. And we have a pre age density of 10 to the six PS CFS per mil, we treated with the only antibiotic was sensitive to and actually, on the day we treated with phage. It was toward the end of that course of antibiotics and his bacterial load actually had gone up two orders of magnitude. We started with phage and immediately saw a big reduction in bacteria density, almost four orders of magnitude and re sensitization that America and he saw some improvement on imaging to the point where surgeons would once again consider the case for removal of abscess.\n\n","    Okay, just a couple more quick ones here with another non CF bronchiectasis this man was injured in a house fire with a lot of smoke 40 years ago, and then had a chronic lung lung infections ever since because a lung tissue was damaged. So his Pseudomonas was resistant to every chemical on ionic, even those in trials. And so he came to us about age, which he did this individual ice. So the first case here on the applaud this the first green section, we saw a big reduction of\n\n","    speed of density and bacteria, three orders of magnitude reduction.\n\n","    And then we treated him again a couple months later, and we saw another reduction of bacteria to the point of where it's below limit detection by the lab and this was a 16 year infection that is eradicated it's important to say that you see the two cultures here on the left. Um, that's the color of the bacteria before treatment and after treatment CCNA reduction of the production of Prasanna which is which is one of virulence factors talked about earlier in this lecture. So we actually made a prediction in the lab of what would happen, I created a visual saw what happened on the on the on the back end of that and actually matched our prediction. Okay, k seven down here is a 38 year old woman with CF. panners isn't Pseudomonas. Again, same stories before we treated with phage targeting pls, which was involved in Prasanna production, we saw an immediate reduction, two orders of magnitude reduction speed and density bacteria. And then we saw an improvement to separate floxin. So she could use that again, and a little bit of an improvement in FPV. One, you see the plates below here are actually agency sensitivity plates we took to some of our top phages. before, during and after phage therapy so the top is before things or screen during therapy is less screen and then after that, if you see three strains that we pulled that were completely devoid, so it's exactly as we would have predicted would have happened.\n\n","    Okay, so just some quick conclusions about this. This least with the with the work we're doing at Yale is that face can force clinically meaningful trade offs in vitro. Okay, lab essays can inform clinical decisions, especially regarding environment selection, we can work with clinicians to identify which pages will work best with certain antibiotics to optimize treatment, okay. Next bring phage treatment, they can be deployed safely and effectively seen zero severe adverse events, no bronchospasm nothing. And they can be deployed effectively to treat these infections, changes in bacterial community during phage therapy can be potentially predicted based on lab essays and CNN with inflammation with drug flux, we can make a prediction and it looks like it works to people. Okay. So, terms of outcome, clinically, clinically meaningful trade offs can be forced in vivo, right? So we can cause bacteria to be drug sensitive again, and cause them to stop producing some of these virulence factors. Okay, so changes in status, therefore, like in terms of improvement, maybe improve lung function, health can be attributed to a phage based intervention. However, in the absence of placebo controlled clinical trials, we can't definitively make that claim. We have a clinical trial that by the time this airs We started, we received permission from FDA to start, we're just finishing manufacturing today. That trial world isn't cystic fibrosis, we're going to work there. And we have two trials planned every year after that. And we're going to be working in different bacteria, different diseases. But until we get these clinical trials up and running, we can't make any claims. So this is where I would normally take questions. However, I obviously can't message me, but you can through email. It's been like every one of my lectures, or Instagram.

Um, so there are several other cases we treated. But after this owner infection that we treated, we basically set up the fH center. I thought I'd take a few minutes here and talk about the H Center. So we have a basic treatment algorithm where we you know, we have people coming in from all across the country or obviously, within Yale health system. With infection treated, we basically identified bacteria in Canada, phage. Syria, we select phage. In device treatment plants, we do an ultra personalized approach, we were very specific on what phages we use and for how long based on lab data, we're doing actual science, where we say, oh, use this page for four days, and then this one for three, and then this combination for another four days, and you have the highest likelihood of doing the bacteria reducing resistance and increasing sensitivity.

This least with the with the work we're doing at Yale is that face can force clinically meaningful trade offs in vitro. Okay, lab essays can inform clinical decisions, especially regarding environment selection, we can work with clinicians to identify which pages will work best with certain antibiotics to optimize treatment, okay. Next bring phage treatment, they can be deployed safely and effectively seen zero severe adverse events, no bronchospasm nothing. And they can be deployed effectively to treat these infections, changes in bacterial community during phage therapy can be potentially predicted based on lab essays and CNN with inflammation with drug flux, we can make a prediction and it looks like it works to people. Okay. So, terms of outcome, clinically, clinically meaningful trade offs can be forced in vivo, right? So we can cause bacteria to be drug sensitive again, and cause them to stop producing some of these virulence factors. Okay, so changes in status, therefore, like in terms of improvement, maybe improve lung function, health can be attributed to a phage based intervention. However, in the absence of placebo controlled clinical trials, we can't definitively make that claim. We have a clinical trial that by the time this airs We started, we received permission from FDA to start, we're just finishing manufacturing today. That trial world isn't cystic fibrosis, we're going to work there. And we have two trials planned every year after that. And we're going to be working in different bacteria, different diseases.

I am Dr. Shawna MacAllan. And I am a phage and clinical researcher here at the bogus University Hospital in Zurich. And I'm happy to be one of the lecturers in this online course series for phages. And today we're going to be talking about my favorite topic, which are clinical trials for phage therapy. And to start off with, I'd like to ask you a question. And that is, why would you take this medicine? So here you can see it's a bottle of aspirin, it's probably something that we've all come across and needed in our lifetimes and anti inflammatory and it's commonplace everywhere, across the world. So if you've answered yes to this question, I want to ask you, would you take this medicine, this is the Pio bacteriophage cocktail produced by elliana in Tbilisi, Georgia. So it is a registered medicine or product in Georgia, and it's sold as an over the counter medicine in the pharmacy. And when you look at these two different products, start to think about what makes you say, Okay, I'll take a pill of aspirin, and maybe might make you hesitate before you would take Pio bacteria phages. And that's really what we want to go through today is to look at why we do clinical trials, because this is what we need in order to bring a product to market.\n\n","    And in order to understand why we do them,\n\n","    we're going to have to briefly look at how they came about through history and where this idea of performing experiments on humans, rather than a test tube or on animals came about.\n\n","    Then we'll move on to when we do a\n\n","    clinical trial, what are the main different parts of a clinical study, before we actually move into the modern trials for phage therapy that have been performed to date. And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics. And in order to understand why we do clinical trials, it's really useful that we look at how drug development occurs. So a lot of what we think about for phage therapy phage experiments is really more this discovery phase where we have a great idea or a problem that needs solving. And we look at this problem or interesting idea through basic research, to in vitro tests in vivo tests. And we usually do this at the university or institutional level. But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.\n\n","    And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations. And depending on where you want to use that drug, you should can take into consideration what the local regulatory authorities are. And Tanzania, which is where we did our last in person lecture series was really impressive, because Tanzania is the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning and regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the w h o. And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market. So they control the access in of drugs into the market. But they also make sure that the drugs that are there are still functioning and safe. And they're still post surveillance studies that are performed even once a drug has a regulatory authorization. And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant. There is another few issues actually that have to do with introducing bias into the way that they structured this investigation is that there was no randomization. So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time. And lastly, but not all. One of the other issues is that this investigation was not blinded. So normally with a clinical trial, we really try not to know, either from the perspective of the patient, or if the treating physician what your patient is actually receiving if they're getting a placebo or the standard of care, or if they're getting the investigational product.\n\n","    And this is ultimately because we have a tendency to introduce biases, maybe you could treat a patient better than another or some way differently if you knew what you were giving them within the clinical trial. And this could really bias your results. Now, where clinical trials really developed was out of, you know, the devastation of World War Two. So this was, unfortunately, during this time, with the Nazi occupation, Nazi concentration camps, there was extreme inhumane experimentation performed on humans. And this really led to the development of ethical codes for how we have to work with patients, ethically, to ensure their dignity, and their well being and their freedom of choice. So this led to a variety of different legislations that have been adopted in various forums across the world, notably the Nuremberg Code, and the Helsinki declaration, that has really improved the way that we treat patients that are part of clinical trials. And overall, what this has led to is that when you perform a clinical trial, not only do you have to have the ethical committee or the regulatory authorities involved, you also to have to have an ethical Committee, which will look at the structure of your study, and possibly do some monitoring of the study to ensure that the patients are treated the way that they should be. And they're, they're ethically treated. And this also means that when we involve any type of human subjects in clinical research, where we make sure that we get informed consent, so that they are aware of what the study is, what they could happen to them, and that they have the right to withdrawal from the study at any point in time, for any reason. And there's also the idea that now patients as well, we have to go to great lengths to anonymize their data and protect their privacy.\n\n","    So really,\n\n","    as time goes on, we see a progression of clinical trials and how we did them. And one of the first randomized clinical trials, or the first actually comes from 1948. And in line with phage therapy, this also also has to do with bacterial infections. And so the first randomized clinical trial was actually investigating the use of structure myosin, to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and this was published in the British Medical Journal. And it was really, really remarkable because through this trial, they were able to show that when you treated with that strep demise, and only 7% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis die, whereas without step two minds and almost one third or 20% of the control patients, they they passed away. So again, that idea of introducing randomization is a way to reduce bias in your clinical trial and to have a greater trust in the data that you produce. So this concludes the first section and I will pick back up with you shortly where we look into the next sections of clinical trials for phage therapy.

And overall, what this has led to is that when you perform a clinical trial, not only do you have to have the ethical committee or the regulatory authorities involved, you also to have to have an ethical Committee, which will look at the structure of your study, and possibly do some monitoring of the study to ensure that the patients are treated the way that they should be. And they're, they're ethically treated. And this also means that when we involve any type of human subjects in clinical research, where we make sure that we get informed consent, so that they are aware of what the study is, what they could happen to them, and that they have the right to withdrawal from the study at any point in time, for any reason. And there's also the idea that now patients as well, we have to go to great lengths to anonymize their data and protect their privacy.\n\n","    So really,\n\n","    as time goes on, we see a progression of clinical trials and how we did them. And one of the first randomized clinical trials, or the first actually comes from 1948. And in line with phage therapy, this also also has to do with bacterial infections. And so the first randomized clinical trial was actually investigating the use of structure myosin, to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and this was published in the British Medical Journal. And it was really, really remarkable because through this trial, they were able to show that when you treated with that strep demise, and only 7% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis die, whereas without step two minds and almost one third or 20% of the control patients, they they passed away. So again, that idea of introducing randomization is a way to reduce bias in your clinical trial and to have a greater trust in the data that you produce. So this concludes the first section and I will pick back up with you shortly where we look into the next sections of clinical trials for phage therapy.

And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics. And in order to understand why we do clinical trials, it's really useful that we look at how drug development occurs. So a lot of what we think about for phage therapy phage experiments is really more this discovery phase where we have a great idea or a problem that needs solving. And we look at this problem or interesting idea through basic research, to in vitro tests in vivo tests. And we usually do this at the university or institutional level. But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.","properties":{"title":[["clinical trial, what are the main different parts of a clinical study, before we actually move into the modern trials for phage therapy that have been performed to date.

And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market.

And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size.

So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time.

And we are back for the second segment of this lecture on clinical trials for phage therapy. And we've just gotten done, speaking about the first parts of why we do clinical trials and also about some of the historical events that have really shaped clinical research today. Now, I'd like to move on and show you some of the main parts of a clinical study, because clinical research is quite different than what we're used to doing in a lab per se. So one of the things is that\n\n","    you have\n\n","    to first define your research question. And the idea is you have a research question in order to address a problem or missing piece of information and afield. So, particularly for phage therapy, our problem is really dealing with antibiotic resistance, or treatment failures for infectious disease. And then with the research question, we want to be able to test a possible solution. And in our case, this is bacteria phages. So an example of a research question would be something like can bacteriophages treat urinary tract infections, infections caused by multi drug resistant bacteria. And we'll see that even this is a little bit broad, and you should start with an idea like this, and then make it even more finer. finer is one of those great acronyms we use to try to guide and structure our research question. So find R stands for F meaning feasible, I meaning interesting, and being novel, ie ethical, we saw earlier that that's very important. And our that is relevant. So you can go through after you've come up with a research question to make sure it kind of ticks all of these boxes as of finer. So if we take the title of this\n\n","    publication, and\n\n","    we try to go through and pick out the Pico characteristics of the study, first we have so who is the population the key and key code, then who are we treating in this, this trial is urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. So that's the population that the study was targeting. Then in terms of the intra intervention, it's intra vesicle bacteriophages. Then for the control, it says in the title, it's placebo controlled, you'll have to read the study to find out what placebo was, then for the outcome, then its treatment. So they're really looking at the ability to treat urinary tract infections. And then if we look at the T, the type of study it is a double blind clinical trial. And I would say they could even gone further and indicated the phase of the study in this case, it would have been a phase two clinical trial.\n\n","    And when we look to design\n\n","    a study, first thing is we want to make sure that the trial is randomized, meaning that when a patient comes in, you don't know which of the treatment arms they'd be allocated to. So there's usually a whole system on how to randomize or a randomizing code. So it's not like the first 10 patients get the intervention. And then the next 10 patients get the placebo, or all of your patients starting with the first letter M get the intervention is usually a much more sophisticated and unpredictable system of deciding which patient gets which treatment. Another aspect for clinical trial design is that the study should be blinded, meaning that you should look at who actually knows who's getting what. So we could do a single blinded trial where only the patient doesn't know if what they're getting, you could do a double blinded trial where the physician, both the treating physician and the patient don't know what they're they're getting or administrating. Or depending on the design of the trial, you could also do a triple blinded saying, you know, maybe it's the person who prepares the medicines\n\n","    or\n\n","    something like that, you can either blind the study further. Then another important aspect is the control arm so you can't just you know, treat all of the patients with phages and then say okay, well this many, they their urinary tract infection got better, you have to be able to compare it to something. So in some instances, depending on the clinical indication, you would compare it to the standard of care that might be antibiotics or an answer my question We'll cream and other instances it would be a placebo. And that really depends on how the indication you're looking at is currently treated and what is ethical. And these three factors are these three things to design into the structure of a clinical trial are really important ways to reduce\n\n","    bias.\n\n","    So reduce sort of trying to structure your study in a way that will influence the final outcome. And then lastly, one other important aspect, super important aspect of a clinical trial is your expected effect. So the way that we judge if a clinical trial is a success or a failure is by looking at the primary outcome. So this is really your bottom line, what is the most important criteria that you are using or you're looking at in a clinical trial, and this is usually something when you're looking at advocacy is it's very patient centric, you know, if phages can make the bacteria go down, that's great. But if your patient still isn't feeling better, then ultimately, you wouldn't use phages in order to treat an infection. So usually, you want to have a primary outcome that is really centered around the patient. But then you can also design into the structure of a clinical trial, secondary outcomes. And this is usually where we add in aspects of microbiology, which is important for phages. Okay, an overall goal of a clinical trial is to obtain a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparing. So between, say, phages, and antibiotics or phages, and placebo, and the way that you judge that is through your primary outcome measure, and then P value of that difference. So the magical p value is really the statistical measure, then that will tell you if based off of all the the analysis you've done, if what you're looking at is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely that the outcome you are looking at is due to due to Chancellor. And my screen\n\n","    is pressing again,\n\n","    there we go.\n\n","    So another criteria, and when you're looking at a clinical trial to make sure that whatever it's saying is really sound is that studying the product safe, that there are no major biases that were introduced in the design of the study. So we saw randomization, blinding and comparatives, that the appropriate measures were taken, and super important for clinical trials are is that you used enough patience, that the intervention and the control were tested on enough people. So we'll see in a little bit that many of the clinical trials today for phage therapy involve a very few amount of patients. And when you don't have enough patients, it's difficult to know if what you're seeing is just due to chance, or if it's really something significant. And now the outcome is of a trial really affect what happens next. So if you can have a phase of a trial, say a phase one trial, and it shouldn't be safe, and then you would be allowed to progress into phase two studies. Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n","    And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem. I'm assuming if you're interested in phages, and phage therapy, then you're aware of this. But when we look back, even 3030 or 40 years ago, we would have a certain number of new antibacterial agents that were approved every year. So we're thinking, you know, back in the early 1980s, or 1980s, were up to 16 new drugs per year still being developed and approved for treating bacterial infections. Whereas now, you look down to the most recent data in this graph from 2008 to 2012. And that's maybe one or two. So that coupled with increasing costs for developing new medicines. Now they estimate that almost 400 and 60 million US dollars are required to go from, you know, when you have that bright idea to getting your authorizations, it's almost 500 million US dollars. And that is just an insane amount of money, especially when we're talking about infectious disease. You couple all of this, with the fact that time is really running out on the utility, we have antibiotics, and new alternatives are desperately needed. So if we look at how this relates a little bit to phage therapy, we've gone through the different studies. So we haven't talked before about phase zero. This is an observational study, which I would highly recommend, especially for phage based trials, because that's where you really look at your baseline demographics of a patient population. So in the incidence of urinary tract infections, for example, you would look to see which pathogens are causing the infection, look at the different strains and maybe their sensitivity to phages. Now, the phases one through four are really when you're in patience, and then this goes up in the probably the cost, but also the amount of patience, and then the different goals that you have for each of the phases. And really, the golden would you say the golden ticket is to get a successful phase three trial where you can obtain a marketing authorization. And now there's been a number shown here in these these small orange arrows of phase one safety studies that have been done with phage products. So if you look through the literature, there's quite a few of phase one trials and to date, there's been no phase one studies that have associated phage products with any type of safety concern. And then there's a few trials that now you can see in the slightly bolder orange arrows that are completed phase two trials. So this is really where they're looking for early signs of efficacy. And now that's what we're going to talk about in the next section after this short break is looking at the for phase two click clinical trials for phage therapy that have been completed today. Alright, see you in a little bit.

Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n","    And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem. I'm assuming if you're interested in phages, and phage therapy, then you're aware of this. But when we look back, even 3030 or 40 years ago, we would have a certain number of new antibacterial agents that were approved every year. So we're thinking, you know, back in the early 1980s, or 1980s, were up to 16 new drugs per year still being developed and approved for treating bacterial infections. Whereas now, you look down to the most recent data in this graph from 2008 to 2012. And that's maybe one or two. So that coupled with increasing costs for developing new medicines. Now they estimate that almost 400 and 60 million US dollars are required to go from, you know, when you have that bright idea to getting your authorizations, it's almost 500 million US dollars. And that is just an insane amount of money, especially when we're talking about infectious disease. You couple all of this, with the fact that time is really running out on the utility, we have antibiotics, and new alternatives are desperately needed. So if we look at how this relates a little bit to phage therapy, we've gone through the different studies. So we haven't talked before about phase zero. This is an observational study, which I would highly recommend, especially for phage based trials, because that's where you really look at your baseline demographics of a patient population. So in the incidence of urinary tract infections, for example, you would look to see which pathogens are causing the infection, look at the different strains and maybe their sensitivity to phages. Now, the phases one through four are really when you're in patience, and then this goes up in the probably the cost, but also the amount of patience, and then the different goals that you have for each of the phases. And really, the golden would you say the golden ticket is to get a successful phase three trial where you can obtain a marketing authorization. And now there's been a number shown here in these these small orange arrows of phase one safety studies that have been done with phage products. So if you look through the literature, there's quite a few of phase one trials and to date, there's been no phase one studies that have associated phage products with any type of safety concern. And then there's a few trials that now you can see in the slightly bolder orange arrows that are completed phase two trials. So this is really where they're looking for early signs of efficacy. And now that's what we're going to talk about in the next section after this short break is looking at the for phase two click clinical trials for phage therapy that have been completed today. Alright, see you in a little bit. Bye.\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["62bf34a8-1e9e-4f94-8fca-760edbb78048","3fd1db50-5833-45a7-9919-5aea73ef39a5","cddcc11f-b588-40cf-91e5-7c164f2c3575","8cacdd96-6bfa-4243-b93e-442b6a125f4c","85ee50d2-e627-4e48-b834-9283dc2c20f6","71020329-5679-4da0-b16f-2f633e9dd2f0","efadea1a-0e61-4194-a39c-b722abfef96a","c3a15749-f41f-41ff-9159-6daa1d99c620","c24ec443-a47f-4e93-903d-8b9fa1ea6232","5c8ec5a2-6ef3-48a4-8a4f-d21f783a6114","9435da35-f087-4fe5-9766-23c1644e7122","21c9636e-f53e-4307-92fc-6df985175b92","e679a39d-90c9-4193-baaf-3602d458b390","ddce5156-1204-419b-82ee-4f2d3120d901","a0d38247-cb36-4528-aee4-d63e3c5537e2","709b5657-06c8-49ab-b49a-cda5bd0057d8","4c0c7b27-00b2-48e7-8adf-ba42c40aa822","68fb6f2f-3a5d-4bf3-8dc8-a42712339d7b"],"content":[{"id":"62bf34a8-1e9e-4f94-8fca-760edbb78048","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 0:00","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 0:00"]]},"parent_id":"7d74e56d-2911-4633-b609-0b885720e11e","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 0:00\n\n"]},{"id":"3fd1db50-5833-45a7-9919-5aea73ef39a5","type":"text","value":"Hi, everyone.","properties":{"title":[["Hi, everyone."]]},"parent_id":"7d74e56d-2911-4633-b609-0b885720e11e","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Hi, everyone.\n\n"]},{"id":"cddcc11f-b588-40cf-91e5-7c164f2c3575","type":"text","value":"I'm Dr.","properties":{"title":[["I'm Dr."]]},"parent_id":"7d74e56d-2911-4633-b609-0b885720e11e","parent_table":"block","markdown":["I'm Dr.\n\n"]},{"id":"8cacdd96-6bfa-4243-b93e-442b6a125f4c","type":"text","value":"Shawna McKellen.

Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n"]},{"id":"68fb6f2f-3a5d-4bf3-8dc8-a42712339d7b","type":"text","value":"And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures. Bye\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["ad44d67b-f87a-437d-bf59-c7de735ac9fc","c56cadd1-0511-4990-89b4-22d80e53c174","27dd6897-7197-4c8e-afb0-9b6175f5c004","c3d2454b-0c12-4cfc-b2b1-302aac089b1c","2badb935-1e2a-4850-9a23-337833fc5542","9b5c24fb-6ea5-492c-9a69-96f7d133ebda","93375d49-2d1b-4712-8d35-f70993f50085","b6a1340d-2790-47c0-989e-02b605175583","8e4b871f-44ea-4da3-ae69-21c97dc29ca0","530f513b-9d42-4100-a3d5-fa79a6359a52","e0b862b8-82ae-4980-9164-d5e8100ea1fa","e16b84a6-c108-454e-8e5c-8959c9627d32","b0ac5246-e81a-4fb4-9bb9-73102db1c77a","ad4a2a4f-5837-463c-ba1a-3a0bf23f5566","97414f59-e2d9-4533-b4b6-ea12685d1cc1","362e210a-a46a-47fd-a543-d9caeeaff788","0fbb91e6-43ca-4ceb-a7b7-6f894bbc5284","30530336-79c1-4165-8ee4-96e011e11220","4c018842-b6c3-49ff-bd2e-1b4180385056","57da1d5c-d431-4f4a-95a8-4c88a95ac70e","81e08935-c759-4498-b1de-9defdc6d679b","77407d78-60a3-4336-9ea8-666bde91bc45","937e1724-70f7-43a2-bbe8-2d1af556ce2c","93d103d8-a94a-470e-b6bf-7e54ae07796a","36812216-6e9d-4249-8017-16c81ae10851","ccb918b0-ddcf-4be9-85d6-f13e9b480723","9d4e36b4-d094-42af-bba0-494abee48b2a","f1a3842d-636f-4606-baea-95438704abc7","7cb73522-def7-4e2f-a49a-47a74b6acbdf","e2b7d2cd-692e-403f-8926-08887931acef","3f03702f-a3f3-4f97-a4fc-30860d92e55a","d798d448-48de-40f0-b27c-56692e69c2e4","cd6c7293-0826-42b7-81e8-0a15816e9f6d","8fae216b-d431-4e76-9d63-435ed16cbe3d","be9aeaf4-0958-49d7-9409-9c6fbd607b04","0c8a4bf1-078d-4ae2-8abc-cddabd19e6b5","1a00d7f7-8399-4832-bf70-246cd94c931c","e49c4ce5-26e8-497c-99b2-7fb5ecce1cb9","f9e2191c-aeeb-44ea-822e-4777dad5aa91","37ccd2fc-d77d-4e3f-8675-b10f85a10a8a","ac9eb5b6-3cc1-469c-8466-3c21f6ee2475","178ee923-e5b7-4d7d-a2c4-347bdaabbcea","84ad5f07-5516-469b-a630-750dd5a70207","e619c631-15d6-4afd-bd2b-b049c84ac9e7","b009b4e3-96f7-42c4-882e-c7037eb82a51","ec174a90-80c5-4c14-880c-42d9ec2af6d2","da737d43-28c4-4984-bc6c-ed96265a498c","634023e3-0ea7-404e-8602-0591b65abb05","8f0482cf-45bd-48a4-a568-11c074df069e","303fd9d8-887a-4826-8c91-983a9f7772f4","f70c3ad5-8c6c-4cf5-8f7f-244c32be5500","d20f2176-3be9-4a83-adfc-b6b561015a0e","268670f8-9c2e-447b-9cf0-0b8bed22ad94","57756f19-8737-4c22-906a-25ec3b85a95e","5fa48b42-a3bd-4e93-a201-c01a1aeee19d","6f46eb00-a1b0-4ff1-b218-4aa15c5e05ab","6045d0aa-268c-4c95-9c18-f95c2c069349","2026fd64-1a2d-4664-83ca-9fd49f984679","2ab7d057-b4a3-44c6-8891-cb43936e9d7a","b3981bec-8ab4-497c-8328-9783a1efdfad","9530b143-013d-4e5b-9444-70a32d0ca737","a4f10f25-adb2-4e7f-8e38-9e8472d998f2","78438a91-a87b-4031-bf0c-fcdc9f1764df","1f4d9875-de3c-4eaa-aec1-493e3ac66691","97544024-17d2-4e16-bb21-1a79479837b1","4b2e140a-40cd-47c0-871f-66296ea183ca","40da93ae-a200-4d8e-a7a6-b5265bf5817b","eec606c6-9acd-450c-b3b0-9791bef41d75","4eaed270-e34e-4ff3-a184-b97f34003f81","c568a5f6-370b-4710-ac0d-2fc02b3f3a17","f0e02cbe-b48d-4205-af53-1ab7f8928fd1","4c6f38f3-a14b-474f-8f1c-2e60d8a52503"],"content":[{"id":"ad44d67b-f87a-437d-bf59-c7de735ac9fc","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 0:00","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 0:00"]]},"parent_id":"967082ba-8a3a-4eb8-ae6f-45d8de4d2bb4","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 0:00\n\n"]},{"id":"c56cadd1-0511-4990-89b4-22d80e53c174","type":"text","value":"Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen.

\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:01\n\n","    Hello everyone, this is dr. john x nalli from the University of Leicester. The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here. The liquid I'm going to transfer is an SM buffer in a falcon tube I have got my P 1000 tips. Remember these will go with the p 1000 p pets. Now, I intend to transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer into the end of chip. So I'm going to take my P 1000 compact\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:31\n\n","    and I just the controller 250.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:35\n\n","    Remember I told you that the numbers on the controller is one digit short. So the 50 is 500 microliters of volume of whatever liquid I'm going to transfer.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:59\n\n","    I'm now going to press the plunger\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:03\n\n","    to the first stop\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:10\n\n","    and push the tip of the micropipette into one of the pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:21\n\n","    While the plunger is still down,\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:27\n\n","    I'm going to insert the tip\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:31\n\n","    just touching the SM buffer remember not to go beyond the pipette tip into whatever bottle or two that you are taking the material from. Once I release the plunger I have already aspirated the platform but microliters and by pressing back the plunger to the first stop, I will not release the material into the eppendorf tube. I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957.

The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here. The liquid I'm going to transfer is an SM buffer in a falcon tube I have got my P 1000 tips. Remember these will go with the p 1000 p pets. Now, I intend to transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer into the end of chip. So I'm going to take my P 1000 compact\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:31\n\n","    and I just the controller 250.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:35\n\n","    Remember I told you that the numbers on the controller is one digit short. So the 50 is 500 microliters of volume of whatever liquid I'm going to transfer.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:59\n\n","    I'm now going to press the plunger\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:03\n\n","    to the first stop\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:10\n\n","    and push the tip of the micropipette into one of the pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:21\n\n","    While the plunger is still down,\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:27\n\n","    I'm going to insert the tip\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:31\n\n","    just touching the SM buffer remember not to go beyond the pipette tip into whatever bottle or two that you are taking the material from. Once I release the plunger I have already aspirated the platform but microliters and by pressing back the plunger to the first stop, I will not release the material into the eppendorf tube. I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957. And I've also clearly demonstrated to you how you can use the micropipette to transport liquids from one container to the other. I hope this video is useful for you and help you in your microbiology research.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame. So this is me now just opening a pipette tip on the burner. And now I'm going to pour a medium into the plate. So I've got my medium which is hot and I'm now going to pour it into the plate I need to keep the plates as close to the fire as possible and the bottle as well. Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing. So whatever has descended on the tip of the bottle need to be sterilized. Now I'm going to show you how I'm going to strip out bacteria. This is a Staphylococcus aureus culture on a blue plate. And I'm going to transfer that to a stereo plate that I've just prepared. Now this plate is all set. So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200. And then you can use that micropipette on the P 200. Tip. Good.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:31\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you my diluent which is going to be assemble for you can use water in this case for your crystal violet, because what we'll be diluting is 1% crystal violates and this will just help to show the graduation or the reduction of the dilution as we go down the tubes. So I'm just opening the tube now. And I am working within a class to safety cabinet. That's why I don't have a flame with me. Now I've taken my P 1000, which is such to 900 microliters capacity. Now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tip. Now I'm going to take one tip. And I'm going to transfer. As I've shown you in my initial video, you have to press the plunger to the first stop. And now I'm going to add the quote. Now 900 microliters of my di D went into the tubes, I have to add this same quantity to all the tubes 900 microliters, of diluent. And as I've said, I'm using SM buffer. But if you do not want to waste your material, you can equally use water to dilute your crystal violet. But if you're diluting your phage, you will need to use assemble for and as you can see, I'm only allowing just the end of the tip to go into the tube do not exceed that because the only sterile part of the pipette is actually the tip. So now I'm going to put the P 1000. aside and close the eppendorf tubes containing my diluent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 7:10\n\n","    All of these contain my daily but not I'm going to pick the crystal violet that I hope to dilute and is going to be 10 for dilution, because each tube is daily diluted a tenfold to the next two. So this is the P 200 tips, which will go with my P 100. I'm going to pick a to a tip Sorry, I'm going to press it to the first plunger. Do not exceed that, or else you're going to take excess amount. So I'm now open my crystal violet. And I'm going to add that to the first tube which is the minus one tube. I'm going to resuspend that couple of time. And I'm going to throw away that pipette tip. After discarding, I will take a fresh tip and transfer material from the minus one\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 8:26\n\n","    tube\n\n","    Janet Nale 8:34\n\n","    into the minus two tube. And I'm going to resuspend that by putting up and down a couple of times to resuspend. And to equally distribute the crystal violet. I've discarded the initial tip and picked a fresh one. Now I'm going to go in to the minus two tube and take 100 microliters in there and that will be transferred into minus three tube. Now discard it again and pay the fresh tip and not open the minus three and that is how I'm going to do until the crystal violet is diluted tenfold across the tubes. So all you're doing is just gradually diluting your initial stock sample reducing the numbers with the amount by a tenfold Just remember to keep changing the tip as you dilute.\n\n","    Janet Nale 9:58\n\n","    That is the minor six We are graduating to minus seven MCs. Good to take that. And now we have added to the minus eight, you may choose to eliminate 100 microliters from the minus minus eight to ensure you've got equal amount. But for this case, this is unnecessary. So I'm just showing you the graduation of the color of the crystal violet within the tube. And as you can see, by the time we get to minus eight, it is basically\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 10:42\n\n","    reduced\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:44\n\n","    drastically to a clear liquid. So for us to actually see this in a visual way, I've now put 96 well plate culture played out. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters of the diluted crystal violet into the well. So I'm just changing the volume setting till I get 200 microliters. So this is p 200 p pet. So it's set. So to 200. So these are my tips, the p p 200. Tips, which will match my P 200. Micro micro pipette. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters to each of the wells. So I'm going to press again the plunger to the first stop. So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n"],"children":["cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","8dd96423-b5ca-4433-bb14-c635df7e0704"],"content":[{"id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"e6b5c475-067b-4ebd-8362-5c8a0a07b510","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:06\n\n","    Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

So all you're doing is just gradually diluting your initial stock sample reducing the numbers with the amount by a tenfold Just remember to keep changing the tip as you dilute.\n\n","    Janet Nale 9:58\n\n","    That is the minor six We are graduating to minus seven MCs. Good to take that. And now we have added to the minus eight, you may choose to eliminate 100 microliters from the minus minus eight to ensure you've got equal amount. But for this case, this is unnecessary. So I'm just showing you the graduation of the color of the crystal violet within the tube. And as you can see, by the time we get to minus eight, it is basically\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 10:42\n\n","    reduced\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:44\n\n","    drastically to a clear liquid. So for us to actually see this in a visual way, I've now put 96 well plate culture played out. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters of the diluted crystal violet into the well. So I'm just changing the volume setting till I get 200 microliters. So this is p 200 p pet. So it's set. So to 200. So these are my tips, the p p 200. Tips, which will match my P 200. Micro micro pipette. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters to each of the wells. So I'm going to press again the plunger to the first stop. So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","2c9f9bce-f342-4c2b-8bfc-7a8fafce4544","5c128188-4fab-4349-b761-089a6b8b314a","3ef5090e-9b62-4960-b40e-7d6b1d099a08","ff484326-0c5c-40cf-987d-80a912a7adaf","6ec64614-6d86-4e3e-8f1b-a653ccdfdb63","49eb0cbf-f40c-4062-ba65-fc4cd25d6d0c","895dc0e1-09ac-464d-81ac-6cc34dcf0817","9a52503d-ed10-4ee8-b18e-ff13a094924b","5f1704f0-df56-414d-b786-8a2b6dd1ad4e","3791ee6e-06ee-4311-b371-ab7bb8ece87f","1f971023-b531-41f3-8a9d-bc0e09f84c94","c0f2b33b-f907-4ad9-a9c7-c69aa34accbf","4002a578-0879-4631-bc49-d17fc4f1d4f8","92badb7c-6d05-4919-a75e-0642123a16f9","7cc5d10b-c74e-4e41-b6c8-3d7e875dad12","5bd83d34-7771-4041-b8e9-1d51ed98f488"],"content":[{"id":"24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 0:06","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 0:06"]]},"parent_id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 0:06\n\n"]},{"id":"852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","type":"text","value":"Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

In this video, we are going to apply our knowledge on serial dilution to be able to enumerate a phage. So if you haven't seen my previous video on how I use crystal violet, diluting it to decreasing concentration, please, I will really recommend that you have a look at that video because that will greatly help in the understanding of the serial dilution that we are going to conduct now on the phage. So I'm going to dilute this page because I need to enumerate the number of phage, or the concentration of phage within this feature lysate that I have got. So I have got a universal truth here containing some phage. So now I'm going to I have already added SM buffer into the tube. And because I'm going to do my dilution in one meal that is 1000 microliters, I have added 900 microliters of the SM buffer into each of the tubes shown in the video. So I've labeled that minus one to minus eight. And I've picked my P 1000 micropipette. And I've set it to 100 microliters. And now I'm going to use my P 200. Tips, which will fit my P 100. micropipette. I'm going to take one of each and transfer 100 microliters. So if you refer back to my video, the crystal violet, I have to use the same method to dilute the crystal violet. And this is a 10 fold serial dilution. So 100 microliters of the phage lysate is going to be transferred to my first tube containing my 900 microliters of the diamond which is SM buffer and I'm mixing it by pipetting up and down just a couple of times using the plunger. I'm going to throw that tip away. And I'm going to take a fresh tip you have to change the tip because you're moving for from a higher concentration to a lower concentration or in your diner. And so I've just aspirated 100 microliters of the minus one diluted sample, and I've added it to the minus two tube, mix it throw away the tape, I'm not taking a fresh tip, and going in to the minus two tube aspirating 100 microliters and then adding that to the minus three tube. And I'm just mixed it might be putting up and down, threw away that pipette tip and then taking the minus three removing hundred microliters into minus four. So this is just diluting my phage from a very high concentration to low concentration in a systematic way using 10 fold dilution methods. And it is reducing my phage to a certain amount that I will be able to count. Now I'm adding from the minus five to minus six. throwing away the pet got fresh pet back to minus six. Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight. So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections.

Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight. So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections.

And today part as part of your lab video series, which you've largely heard from Dr. Janet nalli. Today, I'll be talking to you about sterilizing media. So for many of you, this is probably something that you're quite used to doing. Maybe if you're new edit, there's always some tix tips and tricks to pick up on. So I will go over some of the basic things about how to prepare media, how to mix it well before sterilizing, then how to autoclave it, as well as some common practices for storage. And then very importantly, to always look for contaminations before starting your experiments. So first of all, we talked about preparing media. This is an example of how to make lb growth media. So this is Luria bertani. broth says very commonly used, especially for things like E. coli. So here you've got your recipe, with the different chemicals that you need, shown down here with the different pictures, and then the amount that you need for making a specific volume. So either one leader, as shown here, or sometimes we'll add in if we have a common volume to already pre do the calculation, as shown here for eight liters. So lb broth liquid is usually used to drum in order to make overnight cultures have your bacteria, or with phages, sometimes to do turbidity reduction assays. So you've got your recipe, your chemicals, make sure you've got very clean glassware, as well as a scale to weigh the different chemicals. Now, if we wanted to make another type of media we can build off of this recipe. And the example here I'm showing is how to make lb agar plates. So the petri dishes that you would use in a lot of the types of experiments we would be doing. And so here you use lb IR, to plate bacteria to do viable bacterial enumeration, as well as doing phage specific experiments such as phage, titration, and spot assays. So here, the recipe is the same as before, except for the addition of 15 grams per liter of agere. And now, there's another common media that we use in phage research that I haven't seen in many other experiments. This is lb soft agere or lb sloppy agere. So if you hear soft or sloppy agere, this refers to a type of agbar, that is prepared almost the same well, exactly the same way, except for you add a lower amount of agere into the media, so it's not quite as solid. And we use this when we're trying to mix the phage and bacteria and see their interaction. So we use these for either the spot essays, or for doing phage titrations and double layers. And so as you can see here, instead of 15 grams per liter. And this recipe in our lab, we add four grams per liter for 0.4%. In the final bottle that you'll be using some labs use a slightly higher percentage before I was using 0.7%. So it's just worth looking at see the recipe that you should be following for your experiments. And now here, you can see that when you first start off with, you've got your scale and then whatever you're using to weigh the different chemicals. And you have to make sure that you actually break your scale on zero before weighing. So this is just for the first chemical.\n\n","    And then you add it. So here we've got 10 grams of tryptone. Add that to your bottle, move on to yeast extract, then NaCl and then finally agere. And what's important is that you use one of these recipients and don't add your chemicals directly into the bottle in case that you add too much. And it's very difficult to remove from a mixed solution like that. So weigh them all individually, put them into your bottles. And then when you're ready, it's time to mix. So the first thing is to add an amount of milli q water to a total to the total volume that you're looking for. For example, here you have got one liter so this could be milli q or sterilized double distilled water, something that's quite clean that you'll be using in your final preparation. And then next you have to stir or shake to mixed well. And in order to do that, here you can see the photo that when you prepare the media and you let it sit for some time, it can really sediment on the bottom like this. So you've got really aqueous phase and then all of the agora nutrients kind of collect on the bottom. And what we do to solve that problem is we would add a magnetic stir so you can just drop a little magnetic stir in there, and then put that onto a plate. Here I've got a little video showing how that mixes the media really well. And then once you're done with that, you can see that it really makes everything quite turbid and homogeneous. And if you don't have magnetic stirs, or a stirring plate, that's okay, just make sure bottles closed really well give it a good shake, a lot of times, I'll hit it against my hip, or something to make sure that it really shakes well. And what you're trying to do here is to avoid having like little clumps, or things like that of the media, within the solution itself. Because if you have clumps, when you go to autoclave it, it won't reach or penetrate very deeply in there, to try to mix it as much as you can to remove the clumps. Now, when you're autoclaving, the media, you put it into the autoclave, and what's very important is to label your bottles. So normally, what I'll do is I'll put whatever it is that I've been making, whatever the date is, and my initials. And why it's important for whatever it's, whatever it is, is normally you know, you're putting it into the autoclave, it doesn't mean you're always the person to get it out. So it's important and a good idea to label what it is that you're autoclaving. Now, the second other thing to keep in mind is that you should be using autoclave tape. So this is this nice tape that is white before you put it into the autoclave. And after a certain amount of time, ahead of temperature and pressure, the tape will change color. And I'll show you an example of that in a minute. So another thing is to make sure that you keep the lid open slightly. This is just because when it's getting hot, you need that pressure to be able to remove or else you'll explode your bottle, this would not be very good. So I just tend to open it slightly so that you know if there's steam, it could get out. And then lastly, you would put your your media that you've prepared into the autoclave. And then each autoclave is a little bit different. So this way, you really have to make sure make sure you ask whoever is there who has used the machine before how to use it correctly and safely. Now here you can see the example of when you've got not autoclave versus autoclaved. So this is the way that we know that the media has been properly sterilized. And then after once the autoclave is over, we keep in mind that the bottles and the liquids will be extremely hot. So make sure that you've got gloves or some type of protective wear in order to remove the bottles or just wait for a certain amount of time until it's cooled down a little bit. So media without agbar could then just be taken out and left at room temperature. But if you're making something such as LBI Gar or soft or sloppy, either, you don't want to put that oops, and that's a typo that should not be five that should be 50 to 60 degrees Celsius is gonna make a very big difference. So please take note of that. So if you're making anything with argon, you should let it equilibrate at a temperature of 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. Now this is usually done in either an incubator set at that temperature or in a water bath. And this is because when it comes out of the autoclave, it's super, super hot. And you need to let the temperature cool down to a working temperature where the Aguilar is still in its liquid phase, but that won't burn through your plates or your tubes or kill your bacteria. So another thing to keep in mind is make sure you know we opened it slightly before we put it into the autoclave. Now if this is the right time to make sure that you close the bottles very tightly afterwards\n\n","    to there as a reminder, again to check your labor your lines for the autoclave. And, yes, last reminder, eco delivery at the temperature desired before using and very, very important. Before you would use any of the media you've made containing anger, you know, we shake shook it really well before we put it into the autoclave, but when you take it out, look at it. Again, you'll probably have this sort of sedimentation onto the bottom. So when you take anything with ag or before making plates or doing with anything with the soft dagger, make sure you give it a good shake. Sometimes you'll see the Eiger sort of swirl around and then redistribute in the bottle. Because what happens is if you don't do that, and you take maybe say from this top layer, it doesn't contain as much anger from the bottom and you'll have inconsistent percentages a bag or or even the anger won't solidify. So give it a good shake before using it. Like that. All right, so just a quick word about storing media. The first thing you should ask yourself is does it have Aguilar in it or not? So if not like the lb broth we talked about earlier you Just take it out and leave it at room temperature. Now, if it does contain IR, if you want to use it right away, then you should put it into this incubator or water bath at 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. And this way, it'll cool it down to a working temperature. And if you want to keep it for using later, you can leave it at room temperature at which point it will solidify. But then keep in mind, you have to have some way to remelt it if you want to use it in the future. So maybe a microwave or something, I don't really like to do this, it's kind of a pain. But if that's the way you do things in the lab or the way you have to because you make in a different location, that's okay, just keep in mind, you're going to need to have some way to melt it again, before you could use it in any experiments. And another quick word about using a water bath is that Be careful if you leave something in a water bath too long because contaminations can occur. I've seen this a lot because the water itself can get quite dirty. And then if there's a little drop that gets in, it can infect or contaminate your media. So that brings us on to the last topic, which is contaminations. So what you can see here is that a mold somehow got into the plate, and now has contaminated this this was previously used for bacterial culture. Now this can happen on plates, for example that you've just stored. So say you poured our plates, and you leave them on your bench to cool down and use them the next day. If there's any type of small spores in the air. Or if you weren't using a Bunsen burner or something like that, it's possible that your plates could get a mold like growth on them. And really, what's important is always just to look and check your material before you're using it. So look for mold, or if you're looking at the the liquid media itself, pick up the bottle and swirl it around. And if you see then afterwards, if there's a sort of spiral or like a little hurricane of something inside your media, it's probably because it's contaminated. And you definitely shouldn't use it for your experiments. So again, be careful if you're using a water bath, try not to use a water bath for increased periods of time, like I'll use it for the experiment I'm doing and then I shut it off. So my tubes are in the water only for a few hours. But if you're using it to store your your media really have to make sure that the water itself as well as clean, or you're running an increased risk of contamination. And lastly, if you're pouring our plates, try to store them at four degrees after they've solidified. And until you're ready to use them. And this will also decrease your risk of contamination. So in conclusion, always, always ask about local procedures that they're in place for making media. This can be different in different labs, the best thing to do is follow the protocol and the lab where you're at. Always ask questions and be careful when you're using an autoclave. And then secondly, that's it, use your autoclave, be safe, most important. And then make sure that you will shake your media before you pour plates or doing any type of experiments to really mix that Eiger really well. And then lastly, check for contaminations. So I hope that was helpful. And just a quick reminder for some on how to use and sterilize media properly. Make sure that you're starting off your experiments with something sterile, and that the results you obtain are what you want to see and not because you're married, your media wasn't sterilized property. So thank you and good luck with your experiments.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 13:41\n\n","    Bye\n\n","  </details>\n\n"],"children":["7df93a5a-d397-47bd-9945-c68b72623f9a"],"content":[{"id":"7df93a5a-d397-47bd-9945-c68b72623f9a","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"05fa5cea-41a6-467c-9ccc-deec0984ffd8","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n","    Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen at the bogus University Hospital here in Zurich, Switzerland. And today part as part of your lab video series, which you've largely heard from Dr. Janet nalli. Today, I'll be talking to you about sterilizing media. So for many of you, this is probably something that you're quite used to doing. Maybe if you're new edit, there's always some tix tips and tricks to pick up on. So I will go over some of the basic things about how to prepare media, how to mix it well before sterilizing, then how to autoclave it, as well as some common practices for storage.

In the final bottle that you'll be using some labs use a slightly higher percentage before I was using 0.7%. So it's just worth looking at see the recipe that you should be following for your experiments. And now here, you can see that when you first start off with, you've got your scale and then whatever you're using to weigh the different chemicals. And you have to make sure that you actually break your scale on zero before weighing. So this is just for the first chemical."]]},"parent_id":"7df93a5a-d397-47bd-9945-c68b72623f9a","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen at the bogus University Hospital here in Zurich, Switzerland. And today part as part of your lab video series, which you've largely heard from Dr. Janet nalli. Today, I'll be talking to you about sterilizing media. So for many of you, this is probably something that you're quite used to doing. Maybe if you're new edit, there's always some tix tips and tricks to pick up on. So I will go over some of the basic things about how to prepare media, how to mix it well before sterilizing, then how to autoclave it, as well as some common practices for storage. And then very importantly, to always look for contaminations before starting your experiments. So first of all, we talked about preparing media. This is an example of how to make lb growth media. So this is Luria bertani. broth says very commonly used, especially for things like E. coli. So here you've got your recipe, with the different chemicals that you need, shown down here with the different pictures, and then the amount that you need for making a specific volume. So either one leader, as shown here, or sometimes we'll add in if we have a common volume to already pre do the calculation, as shown here for eight liters. So lb broth liquid is usually used to drum in order to make overnight cultures have your bacteria, or with phages, sometimes to do turbidity reduction assays. So you've got your recipe, your chemicals, make sure you've got very clean glassware, as well as a scale to weigh the different chemicals. Now, if we wanted to make another type of media we can build off of this recipe. And the example here I'm showing is how to make lb agar plates. So the petri dishes that you would use in a lot of the types of experiments we would be doing. And so here you use lb IR, to plate bacteria to do viable bacterial enumeration, as well as doing phage specific experiments such as phage, titration, and spot assays. So here, the recipe is the same as before, except for the addition of 15 grams per liter of agere. And now, there's another common media that we use in phage research that I haven't seen in many other experiments. This is lb soft agere or lb sloppy agere. So if you hear soft or sloppy agere, this refers to a type of agbar, that is prepared almost the same well, exactly the same way, except for you add a lower amount of agere into the media, so it's not quite as solid. And we use this when we're trying to mix the phage and bacteria and see their interaction. So we use these for either the spot essays, or for doing phage titrations and double layers. And so as you can see here, instead of 15 grams per liter. And this recipe in our lab, we add four grams per liter for 0.4%. In the final bottle that you'll be using some labs use a slightly higher percentage before I was using 0.7%. So it's just worth looking at see the recipe that you should be following for your experiments. And now here, you can see that when you first start off with, you've got your scale and then whatever you're using to weigh the different chemicals. And you have to make sure that you actually break your scale on zero before weighing. So this is just for the first chemical.\n\n"]},{"id":"e5f95b6c-7de4-4445-b993-f1e4edb4bc8b","type":"text","value":"And then you add it. So here we've got 10 grams of tryptone. Add that to your bottle, move on to yeast extract, then NaCl and then finally agere. And what's important is that you use one of these recipients and don't add your chemicals directly into the bottle in case that you add too much. And it's very difficult to remove from a mixed solution like that. So weigh them all individually, put them into your bottles. And then when you're ready, it's time to mix. So the first thing is to add an amount of milli q water to a total to the total volume that you're looking for. For example, here you have got one liter so this could be milli q or sterilized double distilled water, something that's quite clean that you'll be using in your final preparation. And then next you have to stir or shake to mixed well. And in order to do that, here you can see the photo that when you prepare the media and you let it sit for some time, it can really sediment on the bottom like this. So you've got really aqueous phase and then all of the agora nutrients kind of collect on the bottom. And what we do to solve that problem is we would add a magnetic stir so you can just drop a little magnetic stir in there, and then put that onto a plate. Here I've got a little video showing how that mixes the media really well. And then once you're done with that, you can see that it really makes everything quite turbid and homogeneous. And if you don't have magnetic stirs, or a stirring plate, that's okay, just make sure bottles closed really well give it a good shake, a lot of times, I'll hit it against my hip, or something to make sure that it really shakes well. And what you're trying to do here is to avoid having like little clumps, or things like that of the media, within the solution itself. Because if you have clumps, when you go to autoclave it, it won't reach or penetrate very deeply in there, to try to mix it as much as you can to remove the clumps. Now, when you're autoclaving, the media, you put it into the autoclave, and what's very important is to label your bottles. So normally, what I'll do is I'll put whatever it is that I've been making, whatever the date is, and my initials. And why it's important for whatever it's, whatever it is, is normally you know, you're putting it into the autoclave, it doesn't mean you're always the person to get it out. So it's important and a good idea to label what it is that you're autoclaving. Now, the second other thing to keep in mind is that you should be using autoclave tape. So this is this nice tape that is white before you put it into the autoclave. And after a certain amount of time, ahead of temperature and pressure, the tape will change color. And I'll show you an example of that in a minute. So another thing is to make sure that you keep the lid open slightly. This is just because when it's getting hot, you need that pressure to be able to remove or else you'll explode your bottle, this would not be very good. So I just tend to open it slightly so that you know if there's steam, it could get out. And then lastly, you would put your your media that you've prepared into the autoclave. And then each autoclave is a little bit different. So this way, you really have to make sure make sure you ask whoever is there who has used the machine before how to use it correctly and safely. Now here you can see the example of when you've got not autoclave versus autoclaved. So this is the way that we know that the media has been properly sterilized. And then after once the autoclave is over, we keep in mind that the bottles and the liquids will be extremely hot. So make sure that you've got gloves or some type of protective wear in order to remove the bottles or just wait for a certain amount of time until it's cooled down a little bit. So media without agbar could then just be taken out and left at room temperature. But if you're making something such as LBI Gar or soft or sloppy, either, you don't want to put that oops, and that's a typo that should not be five that should be 50 to 60 degrees Celsius is gonna make a very big difference. So please take note of that. So if you're making anything with argon, you should let it equilibrate at a temperature of 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. Now this is usually done in either an incubator set at that temperature or in a water bath. And this is because when it comes out of the autoclave, it's super, super hot. And you need to let the temperature cool down to a working temperature where the Aguilar is still in its liquid phase, but that won't burn through your plates or your tubes or kill your bacteria. So another thing to keep in mind is make sure you know we opened it slightly before we put it into the autoclave.

And, yes, last reminder, eco delivery at the temperature desired before using and very, very important. Before you would use any of the media you've made containing anger, you know, we shake shook it really well before we put it into the autoclave, but when you take it out, look at it. Again, you'll probably have this sort of sedimentation onto the bottom. So when you take anything with ag or before making plates or doing with anything with the soft dagger, make sure you give it a good shake. Sometimes you'll see the Eiger sort of swirl around and then redistribute in the bottle. Because what happens is if you don't do that, and you take maybe say from this top layer, it doesn't contain as much anger from the bottom and you'll have inconsistent percentages a bag or or even the anger won't solidify. So give it a good shake before using it. Like that. All right, so just a quick word about storing media. The first thing you should ask yourself is does it have Aguilar in it or not? So if not like the lb broth we talked about earlier you Just take it out and leave it at room temperature. Now, if it does contain IR, if you want to use it right away, then you should put it into this incubator or water bath at 50 to 60 degrees Celsius. And this way, it'll cool it down to a working temperature. And if you want to keep it for using later, you can leave it at room temperature at which point it will solidify. But then keep in mind, you have to have some way to remelt it if you want to use it in the future. So maybe a microwave or something, I don't really like to do this, it's kind of a pain. But if that's the way you do things in the lab or the way you have to because you make in a different location, that's okay, just keep in mind, you're going to need to have some way to melt it again, before you could use it in any experiments. And another quick word about using a water bath is that Be careful if you leave something in a water bath too long because contaminations can occur. I've seen this a lot because the water itself can get quite dirty. And then if there's a little drop that gets in, it can infect or contaminate your media. So that brings us on to the last topic, which is contaminations. So what you can see here is that a mold somehow got into the plate, and now has contaminated this this was previously used for bacterial culture. Now this can happen on plates, for example that you've just stored. So say you poured our plates, and you leave them on your bench to cool down and use them the next day. If there's any type of small spores in the air. Or if you weren't using a Bunsen burner or something like that, it's possible that your plates could get a mold like growth on them. And really, what's important is always just to look and check your material before you're using it. So look for mold, or if you're looking at the the liquid media itself, pick up the bottle and swirl it around. And if you see then afterwards, if there's a sort of spiral or like a little hurricane of something inside your media, it's probably because it's contaminated. And you definitely shouldn't use it for your experiments. So again, be careful if you're using a water bath, try not to use a water bath for increased periods of time, like I'll use it for the experiment I'm doing and then I shut it off. So my tubes are in the water only for a few hours. But if you're using it to store your your media really have to make sure that the water itself as well as clean, or you're running an increased risk of contamination. And lastly, if you're pouring our plates, try to store them at four degrees after they've solidified. And until you're ready to use them. And this will also decrease your risk of contamination. So in conclusion, always, always ask about local procedures that they're in place for making media. This can be different in different labs, the best thing to do is follow the protocol and the lab where you're at. Always ask questions and be careful when you're using an autoclave. And then secondly, that's it, use your autoclave, be safe, most important. And then make sure that you will shake your media before you pour plates or doing any type of experiments to really mix that Eiger really well. And then lastly, check for contaminations. So I hope that was helpful. And just a quick reminder for some on how to use and sterilize media properly. Make sure that you're starting off your experiments with something sterile, and that the results you obtain are what you want to see and not because you're married, your media wasn't sterilized property.

And then make sure that you will shake your media before you pour plates or doing any type of experiments to really mix that Eiger really well. And then lastly, check for contaminations. So I hope that was helpful. And just a quick reminder for some on how to use and sterilize media properly. Make sure that you're starting off your experiments with something sterile, and that the results you obtain are what you want to see and not because you're married, your media wasn't sterilized property. So thank you and good luck with your experiments.\n\n"]},{"id":"e4f75134-ff07-4a4c-8e2a-37e55ed2b6e9","type":"text","value":"Unknown Speaker 13:41","properties":{"title":[["Unknown Speaker
