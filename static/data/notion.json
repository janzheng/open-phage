subtitles Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory. In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.<br>So the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.<br>We have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.<br>phages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.<br>Here's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.<br>We accomplish this mission in two general programs. The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.<br>So these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.<br>From their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.<br>Our first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process. And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019. And we actually had participants from six different countries in West Africa that was hosted in Ghana. And then most recently, in January 2020. We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.<br>Let me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform. We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops. In the most recent East Africa workshop. They came from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, they represented 14 different institutions. And they came from all different levels within their careers, graduate students, technicians, research assistants, lecturers, professors, professors and government scientists. And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.<br>funders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible. So we're very grateful for this community involvement.<br>At this workshop, we had our three original instructors, Professor Martha cloaky, from the University of Leicester, in the UK, and Dr. Janet nali. Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching. This time we had Slav, mich new ski from the University of Warwick in the UK.<br>And the goals of each workshop are not only to learn phage biology and experimental techniques, but also this is really important to develop a network of phage researchers starting in the given region, East Africa or say Southeast Asia, and then helping to connect them to other researchers throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US are America and<br>the topics covered include phage, ecology, molecular biology, various models for studying how phages interact with their bacteria phage applications in agriculture, including both animals and crops, phage therapy, compassionate use cases as well as clinical trials. And then each of the instructors talks about their current area of phage research to give some very practical examples of how phages might be applied. We also try to help the participants of the workshop prepare to get funding for their phage product projects, and also how to engage with the public that might be with a few<br>consumers of their phage product, the regulatory authorities, whoever it may be,<br>to get the support, they'll need to get phages utilized in their country. And then we're constantly compiling collection of key scientific publications. And we discussed that many of those during the workshops.<br>So just to give you an idea, at the end of the first two week workshop, as I said, which was hosted in Uganda in 2017, we were able to successfully isolate some phages, we being the participants of the workshop with support from the instructors. And so here are some transmission electron microscope images, microscopic images of some of the phages that were isolated. We've named these all up for Uganda phage, to a through five B. These were originally isolated from a sewage plant outside Kampala, Uganda, pure originally purified in Uganda and then further characterized back in the UK. And all of these have been made available to the participants of the workshop. So it's exciting to see that within just two weeks, phages can begin to be isolated by these workshop participants.<br>I mentioned that the network develop and the development and the relationships is a really important part of this. And I'm highlighting this spend a few hours together in a sewage plant, and it's a very bonding experience. You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.<br>So let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.<br>Starting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.<br>Then after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And<br>then, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants. So they were either starting new projects or significantly modifying projects that they'd previously initiated, because they'd learned some key things from attending our workshop. There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.<br>Even more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.<br>And at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first<br>from all of the<br>workshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's<br>Just within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.<br>So now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.<br>Our intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries. And it's akin to this saying from Lao Tzu and Martha cookie first made this slide. If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. And so as Martha rewarded this, if you give a woman or man a phage, you may treat one infection. Teach a woman or man how to isolate phages and you may treat multiple infections caused by many different pathogens. And that's our goal and hope here.

In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.<br>So the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.<br>We have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment.

We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.\nLet me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform. We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops. In the most recent East Africa workshop. They came from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, they represented 14 different institutions. And they came from all different levels within their careers, graduate students, technicians, research assistants, lecturers, professors, professors and government scientists. And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.\nfunders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible. So we're very grateful for this community involvement.\nAt this workshop, we had our three original instructors, Professor Martha cloaky, from the University of Leicester, in the UK, and Dr. Janet nali. Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching. This time we had Slav, mich new ski from the University of Warwick in the UK.\nAnd the goals of each workshop are not only to learn phage biology and experimental techniques, but also this is really important to develop a network of phage researchers starting in the given region, East Africa or say Southeast Asia, and then helping to connect them to other researchers throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US are America and\nthe topics covered include phage, ecology, molecular biology, various models for studying how phages interact with their bacteria phage applications in agriculture, including both animals and crops, phage therapy, compassionate use cases as well as clinical trials. And then each of the instructors talks about their current area of phage research to give some very practical examples of how phages might be applied. We also try to help the participants of the workshop prepare to get funding for their phage product projects, and also how to engage with the public that might be with a few\nconsumers of their phage product, the regulatory authorities, whoever it may be,\nto get the support, they'll need to get phages utilized in their country. And then we're constantly compiling collection of key scientific publications. And we discussed that many of those during the workshops.\nSo just to give you an idea, at the end of the first two week workshop, as I said, which was hosted in Uganda in 2017, we were able to successfully isolate some phages, we being the participants of the workshop with support from the instructors. And so here are some transmission electron microscope images, microscopic images of some of the phages that were isolated. We've named these all up for Uganda phage, to a through five B. These were originally isolated from a sewage plant outside Kampala, Uganda, pure originally purified in Uganda and then further characterized back in the UK. And all of these have been made available to the participants of the workshop. So it's exciting to see that within just two weeks, phages can begin to be isolated by these workshop participants.\nI mentioned that the network develop and the development and the relationships is a really important part of this. And I'm highlighting this spend a few hours together in a sewage plant, and it's a very bonding experience. You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.\nSo let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.\nStarting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.\nThen after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And\nthen, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants. So they were either starting new projects or significantly modifying projects that they'd previously initiated, because they'd learned some key things from attending our workshop. There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.\nEven more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.\nAnd at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first\nfrom all of the\nworkshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's\nJust within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.\nSo now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.\nOur intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries. And it's akin to this saying from Lao Tzu and Martha cookie first made this slide. If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. And so as Martha rewarded this, if you give a woman or man a phage, you may treat one infection. Teach a woman or man how to isolate phages and you may treat multiple infections caused by many different pathogens. And that's our goal and hope here. Thanks much.","properties":{"title":[["Auto-generated video subtitles Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory. In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.\nSo the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.\nWe have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.\nphages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.\nHere's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.\nWe accomplish this mission in two general programs. The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.\nSo these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.\nFrom their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.\nOur first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process. And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019. And we actually had participants from six different countries in West Africa that was hosted in Ghana. And then most recently, in January 2020. We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.\nLet me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform.

I am Dr. Shawna MacAllan. And I am a phage and clinical researcher here at the bogus University Hospital in Zurich. And I'm happy to be one of the lecturers in this online course series for phages. And today we're going to be talking about my favorite topic, which are clinical trials for phage therapy. And to start off with, I'd like to ask you a question. And that is, why would you take this medicine? So here you can see it's a bottle of aspirin, it's probably something that we've all come across and needed in our lifetimes and anti inflammatory and it's commonplace everywhere, across the world. So if you've answered yes to this question, I want to ask you, would you take this medicine, this is the Pio bacteriophage cocktail produced by elliana in Tbilisi, Georgia. So it is a registered medicine or product in Georgia, and it's sold as an over the counter medicine in the pharmacy. And when you look at these two different products, start to think about what makes you say, Okay, I'll take a pill of aspirin, and maybe might make you hesitate before you would take Pio bacteria phages. And that's really what we want to go through today is to look at why we do clinical trials, because this is what we need in order to bring a product to market.\n\n","    And in order to understand why we do them,\n\n","    we're going to have to briefly look at how they came about through history and where this idea of performing experiments on humans, rather than a test tube or on animals came about.\n\n","    Then we'll move on to when we do a\n\n","    clinical trial, what are the main different parts of a clinical study, before we actually move into the modern trials for phage therapy that have been performed to date. And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics. And in order to understand why we do clinical trials, it's really useful that we look at how drug development occurs. So a lot of what we think about for phage therapy phage experiments is really more this discovery phase where we have a great idea or a problem that needs solving. And we look at this problem or interesting idea through basic research, to in vitro tests in vivo tests. And we usually do this at the university or institutional level. But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.\n\n","    And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations. And depending on where you want to use that drug, you should can take into consideration what the local regulatory authorities are. And Tanzania, which is where we did our last in person lecture series was really impressive, because Tanzania is the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning and regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the w h o. And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market. So they control the access in of drugs into the market. But they also make sure that the drugs that are there are still functioning and safe. And they're still post surveillance studies that are performed even once a drug has a regulatory authorization. And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant. There is another few issues actually that have to do with introducing bias into the way that they structured this investigation is that there was no randomization. So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time. And lastly, but not all. One of the other issues is that this investigation was not blinded. So normally with a clinical trial, we really try not to know, either from the perspective of the patient, or if the treating physician what your patient is actually receiving if they're getting a placebo or the standard of care, or if they're getting the investigational product.\n\n","    And this is ultimately because we have a tendency to introduce biases, maybe you could treat a patient better than another or some way differently if you knew what you were giving them within the clinical trial. And this could really bias your results. Now, where clinical trials really developed was out of, you know, the devastation of World War Two. So this was, unfortunately, during this time, with the Nazi occupation, Nazi concentration camps, there was extreme inhumane experimentation performed on humans. And this really led to the development of ethical codes for how we have to work with patients, ethically, to ensure their dignity, and their well being and their freedom of choice. So this led to a variety of different legislations that have been adopted in various forums across the world, notably the Nuremberg Code, and the Helsinki declaration, that has really improved the way that we treat patients that are part of clinical trials. And overall, what this has led to is that when you perform a clinical trial, not only do you have to have the ethical committee or the regulatory authorities involved, you also to have to have an ethical Committee, which will look at the structure of your study, and possibly do some monitoring of the study to ensure that the patients are treated the way that they should be. And they're, they're ethically treated. And this also means that when we involve any type of human subjects in clinical research, where we make sure that we get informed consent, so that they are aware of what the study is, what they could happen to them, and that they have the right to withdrawal from the study at any point in time, for any reason. And there's also the idea that now patients as well, we have to go to great lengths to anonymize their data and protect their privacy.\n\n","    So really,\n\n","    as time goes on, we see a progression of clinical trials and how we did them. And one of the first randomized clinical trials, or the first actually comes from 1948. And in line with phage therapy, this also also has to do with bacterial infections. And so the first randomized clinical trial was actually investigating the use of structure myosin, to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and this was published in the British Medical Journal. And it was really, really remarkable because through this trial, they were able to show that when you treated with that strep demise, and only 7% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis die, whereas without step two minds and almost one third or 20% of the control patients, they they passed away. So again, that idea of introducing randomization is a way to reduce bias in your clinical trial and to have a greater trust in the data that you produce. So this concludes the first section and I will pick back up with you shortly where we look into the next sections of clinical trials for phage therapy.

So here you can see it's a bottle of aspirin, it's probably something that we've all come across and needed in our lifetimes and anti inflammatory and it's commonplace everywhere, across the world. So if you've answered yes to this question, I want to ask you, would you take this medicine, this is the Pio bacteriophage cocktail produced by elliana in Tbilisi, Georgia. So it is a registered medicine or product in Georgia, and it's sold as an over the counter medicine in the pharmacy. And when you look at these two different products, start to think about what makes you say, Okay, I'll take a pill of aspirin, and maybe might make you hesitate before you would take Pio bacteria phages. And that's really what we want to go through today is to look at why we do clinical trials, because this is what we need in order to bring a product to market.\n\n","    And in order to understand why we do them,\n\n","    we're going to have to briefly look at how they came about through history and where this idea of performing experiments on humans, rather than a test tube or on animals came about.\n\n","    Then we'll move on to when we do a\n\n","    clinical trial, what are the main different parts of a clinical study, before we actually move into the modern trials for phage therapy that have been performed to date. And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics. And in order to understand why we do clinical trials, it's really useful that we look at how drug development occurs. So a lot of what we think about for phage therapy phage experiments is really more this discovery phase where we have a great idea or a problem that needs solving. And we look at this problem or interesting idea through basic research, to in vitro tests in vivo tests. And we usually do this at the university or institutional level. But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.\n\n","    And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations. And depending on where you want to use that drug, you should can take into consideration what the local regulatory authorities are. And Tanzania, which is where we did our last in person lecture series was really impressive, because Tanzania is the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning and regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the w h o. And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market. So they control the access in of drugs into the market. But they also make sure that the drugs that are there are still functioning and safe. And they're still post surveillance studies that are performed even once a drug has a regulatory authorization. And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant. There is another few issues actually that have to do with introducing bias into the way that they structured this investigation is that there was no randomization. So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time. And lastly, but not all. One of the other issues is that this investigation was not blinded. So normally with a clinical trial, we really try not to know, either from the perspective of the patient, or if the treating physician what your patient is actually receiving if they're getting a placebo or the standard of care, or if they're getting the investigational product.\n\n","    And this is ultimately because we have a tendency to introduce biases, maybe you could treat a patient better than another or some way differently if you knew what you were giving them within the clinical trial. And this could really bias your results. Now, where clinical trials really developed was out of, you know, the devastation of World War Two. So this was, unfortunately, during this time, with the Nazi occupation, Nazi concentration camps, there was extreme inhumane experimentation performed on humans. And this really led to the development of ethical codes for how we have to work with patients, ethically, to ensure their dignity, and their well being and their freedom of choice. So this led to a variety of different legislations that have been adopted in various forums across the world, notably the Nuremberg Code, and the Helsinki declaration, that has really improved the way that we treat patients that are part of clinical trials. And overall, what this has led to is that when you perform a clinical trial, not only do you have to have the ethical committee or the regulatory authorities involved, you also to have to have an ethical Committee, which will look at the structure of your study, and possibly do some monitoring of the study to ensure that the patients are treated the way that they should be. And they're, they're ethically treated. And this also means that when we involve any type of human subjects in clinical research, where we make sure that we get informed consent, so that they are aware of what the study is, what they could happen to them, and that they have the right to withdrawal from the study at any point in time, for any reason. And there's also the idea that now patients as well, we have to go to great lengths to anonymize their data and protect their privacy.\n\n","    So really,\n\n","    as time goes on, we see a progression of clinical trials and how we did them. And one of the first randomized clinical trials, or the first actually comes from 1948. And in line with phage therapy, this also also has to do with bacterial infections. And so the first randomized clinical trial was actually investigating the use of structure myosin, to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and this was published in the British Medical Journal. And it was really, really remarkable because through this trial, they were able to show that when you treated with that strep demise, and only 7% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis die, whereas without step two minds and almost one third or 20% of the control patients, they they passed away. So again, that idea of introducing randomization is a way to reduce bias in your clinical trial and to have a greater trust in the data that you produce. So this concludes the first section and I will pick back up with you shortly where we look into the next sections of clinical trials for phage therapy.

So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time. And lastly, but not all. One of the other issues is that this investigation was not blinded.

And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition.

And we are back for the second segment of this lecture on clinical trials for phage therapy. And we've just gotten done, speaking about the first parts of why we do clinical trials and also about some of the historical events that have really shaped clinical research today. Now, I'd like to move on and show you some of the main parts of a clinical study, because clinical research is quite different than what we're used to doing in a lab per se. So one of the things is that\n\n","    you have\n\n","    to first define your research question. And the idea is you have a research question in order to address a problem or missing piece of information and afield. So, particularly for phage therapy, our problem is really dealing with antibiotic resistance, or treatment failures for infectious disease. And then with the research question, we want to be able to test a possible solution. And in our case, this is bacteria phages. So an example of a research question would be something like can bacteriophages treat urinary tract infections, infections caused by multi drug resistant bacteria. And we'll see that even this is a little bit broad, and you should start with an idea like this, and then make it even more finer. finer is one of those great acronyms we use to try to guide and structure our research question. So find R stands for F meaning feasible, I meaning interesting, and being novel, ie ethical, we saw earlier that that's very important. And our that is relevant. So you can go through after you've come up with a research question to make sure it kind of ticks all of these boxes as of finer. So if we take the title of this\n\n","    publication, and\n\n","    we try to go through and pick out the Pico characteristics of the study, first we have so who is the population the key and key code, then who are we treating in this, this trial is urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. So that's the population that the study was targeting. Then in terms of the intra intervention, it's intra vesicle bacteriophages. Then for the control, it says in the title, it's placebo controlled, you'll have to read the study to find out what placebo was, then for the outcome, then its treatment. So they're really looking at the ability to treat urinary tract infections. And then if we look at the T, the type of study it is a double blind clinical trial. And I would say they could even gone further and indicated the phase of the study in this case, it would have been a phase two clinical trial.\n\n","    And when we look to design\n\n","    a study, first thing is we want to make sure that the trial is randomized, meaning that when a patient comes in, you don't know which of the treatment arms they'd be allocated to. So there's usually a whole system on how to randomize or a randomizing code. So it's not like the first 10 patients get the intervention. And then the next 10 patients get the placebo, or all of your patients starting with the first letter M get the intervention is usually a much more sophisticated and unpredictable system of deciding which patient gets which treatment. Another aspect for clinical trial design is that the study should be blinded, meaning that you should look at who actually knows who's getting what. So we could do a single blinded trial where only the patient doesn't know if what they're getting, you could do a double blinded trial where the physician, both the treating physician and the patient don't know what they're they're getting or administrating. Or depending on the design of the trial, you could also do a triple blinded saying, you know, maybe it's the person who prepares the medicines\n\n","    or\n\n","    something like that, you can either blind the study further. Then another important aspect is the control arm so you can't just you know, treat all of the patients with phages and then say okay, well this many, they their urinary tract infection got better, you have to be able to compare it to something. So in some instances, depending on the clinical indication, you would compare it to the standard of care that might be antibiotics or an answer my question We'll cream and other instances it would be a placebo. And that really depends on how the indication you're looking at is currently treated and what is ethical. And these three factors are these three things to design into the structure of a clinical trial are really important ways to reduce\n\n","    bias.\n\n","    So reduce sort of trying to structure your study in a way that will influence the final outcome. And then lastly, one other important aspect, super important aspect of a clinical trial is your expected effect. So the way that we judge if a clinical trial is a success or a failure is by looking at the primary outcome. So this is really your bottom line, what is the most important criteria that you are using or you're looking at in a clinical trial, and this is usually something when you're looking at advocacy is it's very patient centric, you know, if phages can make the bacteria go down, that's great. But if your patient still isn't feeling better, then ultimately, you wouldn't use phages in order to treat an infection. So usually, you want to have a primary outcome that is really centered around the patient. But then you can also design into the structure of a clinical trial, secondary outcomes. And this is usually where we add in aspects of microbiology, which is important for phages. Okay, an overall goal of a clinical trial is to obtain a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparing. So between, say, phages, and antibiotics or phages, and placebo, and the way that you judge that is through your primary outcome measure, and then P value of that difference. So the magical p value is really the statistical measure, then that will tell you if based off of all the the analysis you've done, if what you're looking at is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely that the outcome you are looking at is due to due to Chancellor. And my screen\n\n","    is pressing again,\n\n","    there we go.\n\n","    So another criteria, and when you're looking at a clinical trial to make sure that whatever it's saying is really sound is that studying the product safe, that there are no major biases that were introduced in the design of the study. So we saw randomization, blinding and comparatives, that the appropriate measures were taken, and super important for clinical trials are is that you used enough patience, that the intervention and the control were tested on enough people. So we'll see in a little bit that many of the clinical trials today for phage therapy involve a very few amount of patients. And when you don't have enough patients, it's difficult to know if what you're seeing is just due to chance, or if it's really something significant. And now the outcome is of a trial really affect what happens next. So if you can have a phase of a trial, say a phase one trial, and it shouldn't be safe, and then you would be allowed to progress into phase two studies. Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n","    And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem. I'm assuming if you're interested in phages, and phage therapy, then you're aware of this. But when we look back, even 3030 or 40 years ago, we would have a certain number of new antibacterial agents that were approved every year. So we're thinking, you know, back in the early 1980s, or 1980s, were up to 16 new drugs per year still being developed and approved for treating bacterial infections. Whereas now, you look down to the most recent data in this graph from 2008 to 2012. And that's maybe one or two. So that coupled with increasing costs for developing new medicines. Now they estimate that almost 400 and 60 million US dollars are required to go from, you know, when you have that bright idea to getting your authorizations, it's almost 500 million US dollars. And that is just an insane amount of money, especially when we're talking about infectious disease. You couple all of this, with the fact that time is really running out on the utility, we have antibiotics, and new alternatives are desperately needed. So if we look at how this relates a little bit to phage therapy, we've gone through the different studies. So we haven't talked before about phase zero. This is an observational study, which I would highly recommend, especially for phage based trials, because that's where you really look at your baseline demographics of a patient population. So in the incidence of urinary tract infections, for example, you would look to see which pathogens are causing the infection, look at the different strains and maybe their sensitivity to phages. Now, the phases one through four are really when you're in patience, and then this goes up in the probably the cost, but also the amount of patience, and then the different goals that you have for each of the phases. And really, the golden would you say the golden ticket is to get a successful phase three trial where you can obtain a marketing authorization. And now there's been a number shown here in these these small orange arrows of phase one safety studies that have been done with phage products. So if you look through the literature, there's quite a few of phase one trials and to date, there's been no phase one studies that have associated phage products with any type of safety concern. And then there's a few trials that now you can see in the slightly bolder orange arrows that are completed phase two trials. So this is really where they're looking for early signs of efficacy. And now that's what we're going to talk about in the next section after this short break is looking at the for phase two click clinical trials for phage therapy that have been completed today. Alright, see you in a little bit.

And we are back for the second segment of this lecture on clinical trials for phage therapy. And we've just gotten done, speaking about the first parts of why we do clinical trials and also about some of the historical events that have really shaped clinical research today. Now, I'd like to move on and show you some of the main parts of a clinical study, because clinical research is quite different than what we're used to doing in a lab per se. So one of the things is that\n\n","    you have\n\n","    to first define your research question. And the idea is you have a research question in order to address a problem or missing piece of information and afield. So, particularly for phage therapy, our problem is really dealing with antibiotic resistance, or treatment failures for infectious disease. And then with the research question, we want to be able to test a possible solution. And in our case, this is bacteria phages. So an example of a research question would be something like can bacteriophages treat urinary tract infections, infections caused by multi drug resistant bacteria. And we'll see that even this is a little bit broad, and you should start with an idea like this, and then make it even more finer. finer is one of those great acronyms we use to try to guide and structure our research question. So find R stands for F meaning feasible, I meaning interesting, and being novel, ie ethical, we saw earlier that that's very important. And our that is relevant. So you can go through after you've come up with a research question to make sure it kind of ticks all of these boxes as of finer. So if we take the title of this\n\n","    publication, and\n\n","    we try to go through and pick out the Pico characteristics of the study, first we have so who is the population the key and key code, then who are we treating in this, this trial is urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. So that's the population that the study was targeting. Then in terms of the intra intervention, it's intra vesicle bacteriophages. Then for the control, it says in the title, it's placebo controlled, you'll have to read the study to find out what placebo was, then for the outcome, then its treatment. So they're really looking at the ability to treat urinary tract infections. And then if we look at the T, the type of study it is a double blind clinical trial. And I would say they could even gone further and indicated the phase of the study in this case, it would have been a phase two clinical trial.\n\n","    And when we look to design\n\n","    a study, first thing is we want to make sure that the trial is randomized, meaning that when a patient comes in, you don't know which of the treatment arms they'd be allocated to. So there's usually a whole system on how to randomize or a randomizing code. So it's not like the first 10 patients get the intervention. And then the next 10 patients get the placebo, or all of your patients starting with the first letter M get the intervention is usually a much more sophisticated and unpredictable system of deciding which patient gets which treatment. Another aspect for clinical trial design is that the study should be blinded, meaning that you should look at who actually knows who's getting what. So we could do a single blinded trial where only the patient doesn't know if what they're getting, you could do a double blinded trial where the physician, both the treating physician and the patient don't know what they're they're getting or administrating. Or depending on the design of the trial, you could also do a triple blinded saying, you know, maybe it's the person who prepares the medicines\n\n","    or\n\n","    something like that, you can either blind the study further. Then another important aspect is the control arm so you can't just you know, treat all of the patients with phages and then say okay, well this many, they their urinary tract infection got better, you have to be able to compare it to something. So in some instances, depending on the clinical indication, you would compare it to the standard of care that might be antibiotics or an answer my question We'll cream and other instances it would be a placebo. And that really depends on how the indication you're looking at is currently treated and what is ethical. And these three factors are these three things to design into the structure of a clinical trial are really important ways to reduce\n\n","    bias.\n\n","    So reduce sort of trying to structure your study in a way that will influence the final outcome. And then lastly, one other important aspect, super important aspect of a clinical trial is your expected effect. So the way that we judge if a clinical trial is a success or a failure is by looking at the primary outcome. So this is really your bottom line, what is the most important criteria that you are using or you're looking at in a clinical trial, and this is usually something when you're looking at advocacy is it's very patient centric, you know, if phages can make the bacteria go down, that's great. But if your patient still isn't feeling better, then ultimately, you wouldn't use phages in order to treat an infection. So usually, you want to have a primary outcome that is really centered around the patient. But then you can also design into the structure of a clinical trial, secondary outcomes. And this is usually where we add in aspects of microbiology, which is important for phages. Okay, an overall goal of a clinical trial is to obtain a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparing. So between, say, phages, and antibiotics or phages, and placebo, and the way that you judge that is through your primary outcome measure, and then P value of that difference. So the magical p value is really the statistical measure, then that will tell you if based off of all the the analysis you've done, if what you're looking at is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely that the outcome you are looking at is due to due to Chancellor. And my screen\n\n","    is pressing again,\n\n","    there we go.\n\n","    So another criteria, and when you're looking at a clinical trial to make sure that whatever it's saying is really sound is that studying the product safe, that there are no major biases that were introduced in the design of the study. So we saw randomization, blinding and comparatives, that the appropriate measures were taken, and super important for clinical trials are is that you used enough patience, that the intervention and the control were tested on enough people. So we'll see in a little bit that many of the clinical trials today for phage therapy involve a very few amount of patients. And when you don't have enough patients, it's difficult to know if what you're seeing is just due to chance, or if it's really something significant. And now the outcome is of a trial really affect what happens next. So if you can have a phase of a trial, say a phase one trial, and it shouldn't be safe, and then you would be allowed to progress into phase two studies. Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n","    And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem. I'm assuming if you're interested in phages, and phage therapy, then you're aware of this. But when we look back, even 3030 or 40 years ago, we would have a certain number of new antibacterial agents that were approved every year. So we're thinking, you know, back in the early 1980s, or 1980s, were up to 16 new drugs per year still being developed and approved for treating bacterial infections. Whereas now, you look down to the most recent data in this graph from 2008 to 2012. And that's maybe one or two. So that coupled with increasing costs for developing new medicines. Now they estimate that almost 400 and 60 million US dollars are required to go from, you know, when you have that bright idea to getting your authorizations, it's almost 500 million US dollars. And that is just an insane amount of money, especially when we're talking about infectious disease. You couple all of this, with the fact that time is really running out on the utility, we have antibiotics, and new alternatives are desperately needed. So if we look at how this relates a little bit to phage therapy, we've gone through the different studies. So we haven't talked before about phase zero. This is an observational study, which I would highly recommend, especially for phage based trials, because that's where you really look at your baseline demographics of a patient population. So in the incidence of urinary tract infections, for example, you would look to see which pathogens are causing the infection, look at the different strains and maybe their sensitivity to phages.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures. Bye\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["ad44d67b-f87a-437d-bf59-c7de735ac9fc","c56cadd1-0511-4990-89b4-22d80e53c174","27dd6897-7197-4c8e-afb0-9b6175f5c004","c3d2454b-0c12-4cfc-b2b1-302aac089b1c","2badb935-1e2a-4850-9a23-337833fc5542","9b5c24fb-6ea5-492c-9a69-96f7d133ebda","93375d49-2d1b-4712-8d35-f70993f50085","b6a1340d-2790-47c0-989e-02b605175583","8e4b871f-44ea-4da3-ae69-21c97dc29ca0","530f513b-9d42-4100-a3d5-fa79a6359a52","e0b862b8-82ae-4980-9164-d5e8100ea1fa","e16b84a6-c108-454e-8e5c-8959c9627d32","b0ac5246-e81a-4fb4-9bb9-73102db1c77a","ad4a2a4f-5837-463c-ba1a-3a0bf23f5566","97414f59-e2d9-4533-b4b6-ea12685d1cc1","362e210a-a46a-47fd-a543-d9caeeaff788","0fbb91e6-43ca-4ceb-a7b7-6f894bbc5284","30530336-79c1-4165-8ee4-96e011e11220","4c018842-b6c3-49ff-bd2e-1b4180385056","57da1d5c-d431-4f4a-95a8-4c88a95ac70e","81e08935-c759-4498-b1de-9defdc6d679b","77407d78-60a3-4336-9ea8-666bde91bc45","937e1724-70f7-43a2-bbe8-2d1af556ce2c","93d103d8-a94a-470e-b6bf-7e54ae07796a","36812216-6e9d-4249-8017-16c81ae10851","ccb918b0-ddcf-4be9-85d6-f13e9b480723","9d4e36b4-d094-42af-bba0-494abee48b2a","f1a3842d-636f-4606-baea-95438704abc7","7cb73522-def7-4e2f-a49a-47a74b6acbdf","e2b7d2cd-692e-403f-8926-08887931acef","3f03702f-a3f3-4f97-a4fc-30860d92e55a","d798d448-48de-40f0-b27c-56692e69c2e4","cd6c7293-0826-42b7-81e8-0a15816e9f6d","8fae216b-d431-4e76-9d63-435ed16cbe3d","be9aeaf4-0958-49d7-9409-9c6fbd607b04","0c8a4bf1-078d-4ae2-8abc-cddabd19e6b5","1a00d7f7-8399-4832-bf70-246cd94c931c","e49c4ce5-26e8-497c-99b2-7fb5ecce1cb9","f9e2191c-aeeb-44ea-822e-4777dad5aa91","37ccd2fc-d77d-4e3f-8675-b10f85a10a8a","ac9eb5b6-3cc1-469c-8466-3c21f6ee2475","178ee923-e5b7-4d7d-a2c4-347bdaabbcea","84ad5f07-5516-469b-a630-750dd5a70207","e619c631-15d6-4afd-bd2b-b049c84ac9e7","b009b4e3-96f7-42c4-882e-c7037eb82a51","ec174a90-80c5-4c14-880c-42d9ec2af6d2","da737d43-28c4-4984-bc6c-ed96265a498c","634023e3-0ea7-404e-8602-0591b65abb05","8f0482cf-45bd-48a4-a568-11c074df069e","303fd9d8-887a-4826-8c91-983a9f7772f4","f70c3ad5-8c6c-4cf5-8f7f-244c32be5500","d20f2176-3be9-4a83-adfc-b6b561015a0e","268670f8-9c2e-447b-9cf0-0b8bed22ad94","57756f19-8737-4c22-906a-25ec3b85a95e","5fa48b42-a3bd-4e93-a201-c01a1aeee19d","6f46eb00-a1b0-4ff1-b218-4aa15c5e05ab","6045d0aa-268c-4c95-9c18-f95c2c069349","2026fd64-1a2d-4664-83ca-9fd49f984679","2ab7d057-b4a3-44c6-8891-cb43936e9d7a","b3981bec-8ab4-497c-8328-9783a1efdfad","9530b143-013d-4e5b-9444-70a32d0ca737","a4f10f25-adb2-4e7f-8e38-9e8472d998f2","78438a91-a87b-4031-bf0c-fcdc9f1764df","1f4d9875-de3c-4eaa-aec1-493e3ac66691","97544024-17d2-4e16-bb21-1a79479837b1","4b2e140a-40cd-47c0-871f-66296ea183ca","40da93ae-a200-4d8e-a7a6-b5265bf5817b","eec606c6-9acd-450c-b3b0-9791bef41d75","4eaed270-e34e-4ff3-a184-b97f34003f81","c568a5f6-370b-4710-ac0d-2fc02b3f3a17","f0e02cbe-b48d-4205-af53-1ab7f8928fd1","4c6f38f3-a14b-474f-8f1c-2e60d8a52503"],"content":[{"id":"ad44d67b-f87a-437d-bf59-c7de735ac9fc","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 0:00","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 0:00"]]},"parent_id":"967082ba-8a3a-4eb8-ae6f-45d8de4d2bb4","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 0:00\n\n"]},{"id":"c56cadd1-0511-4990-89b4-22d80e53c174","type":"text","value":"Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen.

So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials. Now when we look at how this falls into development for antimicrobial therapy, we know that since the 1980s, the number of new antibacterial agents being discovered and developed is drastically decreasing. So here you can see that there were about 16 new agents that were discovered in the 1980s. And then we have as few as two between 2008 and 2012. Now this is partially due to the fact that clinical trials are extremely expensive. So here you can see that the estimate is you know, 400 and $60 million. If you want to believe During a clinical drug to market, and this is just something that's extremely difficult to do. And unfortunately, antibiotics are not something that drug companies can then make a lot of money out of. So they have less of an inherent motivation to put money into a clinical trial, because they have less ability to get money back out of the drug being authorized itself. And we put this into the context of antimicrobial resistance. And we realize that we're really on the clock here, in order to develop new anti microbial therapies in order to address the problems that we're seeing with antibiotic failures. Now, we've touched a little bit here and there about the different phases of clinical trials from zero to four. And when we start at zero, this is usually just an observational study. So this is when you're not applying any type of product to a patient, you're just simply trying to look and see what the demographics or the epidemiology of your target population is. And then you can move on to safety. So this is phase one. And we said earlier that traditionally, this is done in healthy subjects. So you would be putting your product or your phages into a healthy person, and just making sure that when everything else is going well, that the drug product itself isn't causing any adverse effects. And then phase two is we're still of course, considering safety, we always consider safety. But this is when we start to look at efficacy, because now we're normally in a patient population that is afflicted by the\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:43\n\n","    the condition that we're trying to treat. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:46\n\n","    then once we move into phase three, this is really where we're trying to decide or to determine if the product is effective for treating a specific condition or not. And you have a larger population size than what you did in phase two trials. Now, it's at this point that after the completion, the successful completion of a phase three trial, that it would be possible to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. And this is really again, what companies really try to do with their drugs is because once they obtain a marketing authorization, and they're able to sell, sell, distribute and treat patients, but even after a drug or a product receives a marketing authorization, they're still phase four studies. So this is called post marketing surveillance studies. And this is when it's still\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:41\n\n","    required that the company would then follow patients who are receiving this drug over a longer amount of time to make sure that there's no adverse effects that develop on a larger scale. And we when we look at the different phases, in terms of what's been done for phage therapy, there's been a number of different phase one trials done to determine safety. And this is this will cover different types of infections. And we'll cover healthy volunteers as well as some even some patients. And this will cover a lot of different products from something as you know, as simple as a single phage, something as complex as maybe 10 or 12 pages or so there's been a number of these phase one studies done. And there's also been several efficacy studies. So these are the phase two studies that have already been completed.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:33\n\n","    And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:35\n\n","    this is really where the next section we're going to delve into these four phase two trials that have been completed for phage therapy. And if you want to have a little look and read deeper into the literature, I'll just tell you here now before we take a break, the four different publications that we'll discuss more in detail. So the first one was by right and all in 2009. And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy. Now, the second trial that was published was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to Cali phage preparations and a randomized control trial and children from Bangladesh. This was published by sarker and all in 2016. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:32\n\n","    then a third trial we have\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:34\n\n","    was the Fagor burn trial if you've ever heard of that, this is the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial This was published by jolt and all in 2019 in The Lancet, and very recently, in a trial that I was involved with was the intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer through a resection of the prostate, a randomized placebo controlled double blind trial. So all of them have these, you know, very long and complex titles. So if you're interested, you can take the time to read them individually. And I would suggest trying to look at the titles and pick out this Pico information. So the population outcome control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:29\n\n","    P. control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:33\n\n","    those letters that we talked about earlier, you can come back and look at them, but just have a look at the title. And go through and see if you can pick out yourself all of that important information. And then now We'll take a short break and I'll see you hopefully in a little bit to go over each of them then\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n"],"children":["382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","209d8623-fef9-4522-8d88-90908c0fd758"],"content":[{"id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"f51a1bf0-adf2-422d-80ed-8808a5eb51eb","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n","    Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy.

So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content.

A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial.

So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died.

And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials. Now when we look at how this falls into development for antimicrobial therapy, we know that since the 1980s, the number of new antibacterial agents being discovered and developed is drastically decreasing. So here you can see that there were about 16 new agents that were discovered in the 1980s. And then we have as few as two between 2008 and 2012. Now this is partially due to the fact that clinical trials are extremely expensive. So here you can see that the estimate is you know, 400 and $60 million. If you want to believe During a clinical drug to market, and this is just something that's extremely difficult to do. And unfortunately, antibiotics are not something that drug companies can then make a lot of money out of. So they have less of an inherent motivation to put money into a clinical trial, because they have less ability to get money back out of the drug being authorized itself. And we put this into the context of antimicrobial resistance. And we realize that we're really on the clock here, in order to develop new anti microbial therapies in order to address the problems that we're seeing with antibiotic failures. Now, we've touched a little bit here and there about the different phases of clinical trials from zero to four. And when we start at zero, this is usually just an observational study. So this is when you're not applying any type of product to a patient, you're just simply trying to look and see what the demographics or the epidemiology of your target population is. And then you can move on to safety. So this is phase one. And we said earlier that traditionally, this is done in healthy subjects. So you would be putting your product or your phages into a healthy person, and just making sure that when everything else is going well, that the drug product itself isn't causing any adverse effects. And then phase two is we're still of course, considering safety, we always consider safety. But this is when we start to look at efficacy, because now we're normally in a patient population that is afflicted by the\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:43\n\n","    the condition that we're trying to treat. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:46\n\n","    then once we move into phase three, this is really where we're trying to decide or to determine if the product is effective for treating a specific condition or not. And you have a larger population size than what you did in phase two trials. Now, it's at this point that after the completion, the successful completion of a phase three trial, that it would be possible to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. And this is really again, what companies really try to do with their drugs is because once they obtain a marketing authorization, and they're able to sell, sell, distribute and treat patients, but even after a drug or a product receives a marketing authorization, they're still phase four studies. So this is called post marketing surveillance studies. And this is when it's still\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:41\n\n","    required that the company would then follow patients who are receiving this drug over a longer amount of time to make sure that there's no adverse effects that develop on a larger scale. And we when we look at the different phases, in terms of what's been done for phage therapy, there's been a number of different phase one trials done to determine safety. And this is this will cover different types of infections. And we'll cover healthy volunteers as well as some even some patients. And this will cover a lot of different products from something as you know, as simple as a single phage, something as complex as maybe 10 or 12 pages or so there's been a number of these phase one studies done. And there's also been several efficacy studies. So these are the phase two studies that have already been completed.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:33\n\n","    And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:35\n\n","    this is really where the next section we're going to delve into these four phase two trials that have been completed for phage therapy. And if you want to have a little look and read deeper into the literature, I'll just tell you here now before we take a break, the four different publications that we'll discuss more in detail. So the first one was by right and all in 2009. And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy. Now, the second trial that was published was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to Cali phage preparations and a randomized control trial and children from Bangladesh. This was published by sarker and all in 2016. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:32\n\n","    then a third trial we have\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:34\n\n","    was the Fagor burn trial if you've ever heard of that, this is the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial This was published by jolt and all in 2019 in The Lancet, and very recently, in a trial that I was involved with was the intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer through a resection of the prostate, a randomized placebo controlled double blind trial. So all of them have these, you know, very long and complex titles. So if you're interested, you can take the time to read them individually. And I would suggest trying to look at the titles and pick out this Pico information. So the population outcome control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:29\n\n","    P. control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:33\n\n","    those letters that we talked about earlier, you can come back and look at them, but just have a look at the title. And go through and see if you can pick out yourself all of that important information. And then now We'll take a short break and I'll see you hopefully in a little bit to go over each of them then\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["a2b12c9f-f8dc-4897-ab42-9e9c7de639a0","ff660b54-bc11-4ffb-bb2d-e1b4afd994af","9443a535-dc5b-473c-b107-34f8706ec083","46fe2fa7-1b50-4646-9142-ee8d50e5e315","f183f1e5-dcf2-46e4-ba0d-77839b52956c","462b5626-ea5e-40df-b655-c1a4cf70f623","4976a1be-c75d-4140-934c-9fa4df70febb","f0e5e1bd-eac9-447c-981d-1f3428c872eb","1c0a9ed2-dca5-4cc2-8c65-ccad444df608","08ef6ecb-895b-4c78-8916-eec8fdf971b0","54ac1e9d-ddb4-4337-9d01-b79cf9a6f52a","54f03b4f-275d-4153-9080-0e2b9e9fa731","5ce85b4d-634d-4a87-8f20-c50b13851842","2f71924a-34f1-4c5e-817d-4ad8e2dce4e1","df6d0a12-c871-4d2f-bb84-e2b91135c3b3","0beb4dc9-95e0-40b3-a78b-90a70a36f023","c6ac39bd-f79c-4846-80a9-7377ef4f3e9b","f1eafbf9-d41b-4368-9ed3-2278e31b2d90","a0be69ce-03ce-4eb3-a936-d81c8c600b33","a265875f-f804-450b-8a48-38f29bd2bca8","0eb34d40-998f-4a45-9c56-b29c24e46900","6f50b966-cd15-4b5e-9ce1-67a9cabb040d","bcc6abdc-86b2-4add-ab72-9640cd46dc4d","9e0f8946-623d-4581-97f7-f86fb6bdbce8","515c403d-c770-4174-bc2e-d1e76be56418","2300cb27-4623-417a-a694-5c2f93d32b1a","9483c553-5171-4b2a-bc4c-27a639e3226b","5270311e-693a-42cd-bf7e-b0be1f9809a7","e7feab48-f1e6-49c2-a1cc-eb061f4b820b","86a6984c-887a-47d8-b43d-1c9c30142553","000bedff-f926-4a9c-ae70-41764c172e14","0fc6fd65-bd3f-4876-b7c6-1f6b558c4488","9a711e3b-7b68-4022-974e-a1e4cc69d398","2d871c4f-9b97-4d3a-a237-625fa3deaba6","57218270-59b7-4fb5-ac71-105eff2712e3","749bcdbf-db71-46ea-be21-929b8b97a850"],"content":[{"id":"a2b12c9f-f8dc-4897-ab42-9e9c7de639a0","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 0:01","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 0:01"]]},"parent_id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n"]},{"id":"ff660b54-bc11-4ffb-bb2d-e1b4afd994af","type":"text","value":"Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.","properties":{"title":[["Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland.

And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.","properties":{"title":[["Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization.

And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will.

And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection.

So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.","properties":{"title":[["And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable.

\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:01\n\n","    Hello everyone, this is dr. john x nalli from the University of Leicester. The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here. The liquid I'm going to transfer is an SM buffer in a falcon tube I have got my P 1000 tips. Remember these will go with the p 1000 p pets. Now, I intend to transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer into the end of chip. So I'm going to take my P 1000 compact\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:31\n\n","    and I just the controller 250.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:35\n\n","    Remember I told you that the numbers on the controller is one digit short. So the 50 is 500 microliters of volume of whatever liquid I'm going to transfer.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:59\n\n","    I'm now going to press the plunger\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:03\n\n","    to the first stop\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:10\n\n","    and push the tip of the micropipette into one of the pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:21\n\n","    While the plunger is still down,\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:27\n\n","    I'm going to insert the tip\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:31\n\n","    just touching the SM buffer remember not to go beyond the pipette tip into whatever bottle or two that you are taking the material from. Once I release the plunger I have already aspirated the platform but microliters and by pressing back the plunger to the first stop, I will not release the material into the eppendorf tube. I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957. And I've also clearly demonstrated to you how you can use the micropipette to transport liquids from one container to the other. I hope this video is useful for you and help you in your microbiology research. Thank you\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n"],"children":["fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","32df0402-a320-4d52-ab53-bdc009a68c13"],"content":[{"id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"60e3a537-8403-4825-b254-1ab9630191ad","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    \n\n","    Janet Nale 0:01\n\n","    Hello everyone, this is dr. john x nalli from the University of Leicester.

The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here. The liquid I'm going to transfer is an SM buffer in a falcon tube I have got my P 1000 tips. Remember these will go with the p 1000 p pets. Now, I intend to transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer into the end of chip. So I'm going to take my P 1000 compact\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:31\n\n","    and I just the controller 250.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:35\n\n","    Remember I told you that the numbers on the controller is one digit short. So the 50 is 500 microliters of volume of whatever liquid I'm going to transfer.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:59\n\n","    I'm now going to press the plunger\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:03\n\n","    to the first stop\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:10\n\n","    and push the tip of the micropipette into one of the pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:21\n\n","    While the plunger is still down,\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:27\n\n","    I'm going to insert the tip\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:31\n\n","    just touching the SM buffer remember not to go beyond the pipette tip into whatever bottle or two that you are taking the material from. Once I release the plunger I have already aspirated the platform but microliters and by pressing back the plunger to the first stop, I will not release the material into the eppendorf tube. I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957. And I've also clearly demonstrated to you how you can use the micropipette to transport liquids from one container to the other. I hope this video is useful for you and help you in your microbiology research.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame. So this is me now just opening a pipette tip on the burner. And now I'm going to pour a medium into the plate. So I've got my medium which is hot and I'm now going to pour it into the plate I need to keep the plates as close to the fire as possible and the bottle as well. Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing. So whatever has descended on the tip of the bottle need to be sterilized. Now I'm going to show you how I'm going to strip out bacteria. This is a Staphylococcus aureus culture on a blue plate. And I'm going to transfer that to a stereo plate that I've just prepared. Now this plate is all set. So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200. And then you can use that micropipette on the P 200. Tip. Good.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:31\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you my diluent which is going to be assemble for you can use water in this case for your crystal violet, because what we'll be diluting is 1% crystal violates and this will just help to show the graduation or the reduction of the dilution as we go down the tubes. So I'm just opening the tube now. And I am working within a class to safety cabinet. That's why I don't have a flame with me. Now I've taken my P 1000, which is such to 900 microliters capacity. Now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tip. Now I'm going to take one tip. And I'm going to transfer. As I've shown you in my initial video, you have to press the plunger to the first stop. And now I'm going to add the quote. Now 900 microliters of my di D went into the tubes, I have to add this same quantity to all the tubes 900 microliters, of diluent. And as I've said, I'm using SM buffer. But if you do not want to waste your material, you can equally use water to dilute your crystal violet. But if you're diluting your phage, you will need to use assemble for and as you can see, I'm only allowing just the end of the tip to go into the tube do not exceed that because the only sterile part of the pipette is actually the tip. So now I'm going to put the P 1000. aside and close the eppendorf tubes containing my diluent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 7:10\n\n","    All of these contain my daily but not I'm going to pick the crystal violet that I hope to dilute and is going to be 10 for dilution, because each tube is daily diluted a tenfold to the next two. So this is the P 200 tips, which will go with my P 100. I'm going to pick a to a tip Sorry, I'm going to press it to the first plunger. Do not exceed that, or else you're going to take excess amount. So I'm now open my crystal violet. And I'm going to add that to the first tube which is the minus one tube. I'm going to resuspend that couple of time. And I'm going to throw away that pipette tip. After discarding, I will take a fresh tip and transfer material from the minus one\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 8:26\n\n","    tube\n\n","    Janet Nale 8:34\n\n","    into the minus two tube. And I'm going to resuspend that by putting up and down a couple of times to resuspend. And to equally distribute the crystal violet. I've discarded the initial tip and picked a fresh one. Now I'm going to go in to the minus two tube and take 100 microliters in there and that will be transferred into minus three tube. Now discard it again and pay the fresh tip and not open the minus three and that is how I'm going to do until the crystal violet is diluted tenfold across the tubes. So all you're doing is just gradually diluting your initial stock sample reducing the numbers with the amount by a tenfold Just remember to keep changing the tip as you dilute.\n\n","    Janet Nale 9:58\n\n","    That is the minor six We are graduating to minus seven MCs. Good to take that. And now we have added to the minus eight, you may choose to eliminate 100 microliters from the minus minus eight to ensure you've got equal amount. But for this case, this is unnecessary. So I'm just showing you the graduation of the color of the crystal violet within the tube. And as you can see, by the time we get to minus eight, it is basically\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 10:42\n\n","    reduced\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:44\n\n","    drastically to a clear liquid. So for us to actually see this in a visual way, I've now put 96 well plate culture played out. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters of the diluted crystal violet into the well. So I'm just changing the volume setting till I get 200 microliters. So this is p 200 p pet. So it's set. So to 200. So these are my tips, the p p 200. Tips, which will match my P 200. Micro micro pipette. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters to each of the wells. So I'm going to press again the plunger to the first stop. So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n"],"children":["cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","8dd96423-b5ca-4433-bb14-c635df7e0704"],"content":[{"id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"e6b5c475-067b-4ebd-8362-5c8a0a07b510","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:06\n\n","    Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","2c9f9bce-f342-4c2b-8bfc-7a8fafce4544","5c128188-4fab-4349-b761-089a6b8b314a","3ef5090e-9b62-4960-b40e-7d6b1d099a08","ff484326-0c5c-40cf-987d-80a912a7adaf","6ec64614-6d86-4e3e-8f1b-a653ccdfdb63","49eb0cbf-f40c-4062-ba65-fc4cd25d6d0c","895dc0e1-09ac-464d-81ac-6cc34dcf0817","9a52503d-ed10-4ee8-b18e-ff13a094924b","5f1704f0-df56-414d-b786-8a2b6dd1ad4e","3791ee6e-06ee-4311-b371-ab7bb8ece87f","1f971023-b531-41f3-8a9d-bc0e09f84c94","c0f2b33b-f907-4ad9-a9c7-c69aa34accbf","4002a578-0879-4631-bc49-d17fc4f1d4f8","92badb7c-6d05-4919-a75e-0642123a16f9","7cc5d10b-c74e-4e41-b6c8-3d7e875dad12","5bd83d34-7771-4041-b8e9-1d51ed98f488"],"content":[{"id":"24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 0:06","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 0:06"]]},"parent_id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 0:06\n\n"]},{"id":"852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","type":"text","value":"Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight.

In this video, we are going to apply our knowledge on serial dilution to be able to enumerate a phage. So if you haven't seen my previous video on how I use crystal violet, diluting it to decreasing concentration, please, I will really recommend that you have a look at that video because that will greatly help in the understanding of the serial dilution that we are going to conduct now on the phage. So I'm going to dilute this page because I need to enumerate the number of phage, or the concentration of phage within this feature lysate that I have got. So I have got a universal truth here containing some phage. So now I'm going to I have already added SM buffer into the tube. And because I'm going to do my dilution in one meal that is 1000 microliters, I have added 900 microliters of the SM buffer into each of the tubes shown in the video. So I've labeled that minus one to minus eight. And I've picked my P 1000 micropipette. And I've set it to 100 microliters. And now I'm going to use my P 200. Tips, which will fit my P 100. micropipette. I'm going to take one of each and transfer 100 microliters. So if you refer back to my video, the crystal violet, I have to use the same method to dilute the crystal violet. And this is a 10 fold serial dilution. So 100 microliters of the phage lysate is going to be transferred to my first tube containing my 900 microliters of the diamond which is SM buffer and I'm mixing it by pipetting up and down just a couple of times using the plunger. I'm going to throw that tip away. And I'm going to take a fresh tip you have to change the tip because you're moving for from a higher concentration to a lower concentration or in your diner. And so I've just aspirated 100 microliters of the minus one diluted sample, and I've added it to the minus two tube, mix it throw away the tape, I'm not taking a fresh tip, and going in to the minus two tube aspirating 100 microliters and then adding that to the minus three tube. And I'm just mixed it might be putting up and down, threw away that pipette tip and then taking the minus three removing hundred microliters into minus four. So this is just diluting my phage from a very high concentration to low concentration in a systematic way using 10 fold dilution methods. And it is reducing my phage to a certain amount that I will be able to count. Now I'm adding from the minus five to minus six. throwing away the pet got fresh pet back to minus six. Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight. So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections.

So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections. Thank you\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["cd339060-773e-43db-8788-d767b01ca0cb","27cba1a7-e764-4963-b67e-360b79efd5b5","52652128-5a30-4916-85d1-6e7b9c7705e4","4a0adb0a-3bd2-489b-982b-d93e8a4e9cdd","8331f157-f4e0-4572-a722-d4634a0d41f4","40c94dab-a278-4154-b55b-cae86d8ce2fe","945ff7ed-5ee4-492c-a0b4-511f3e63988b","8b6c4392-4800-4e12-87bc-ea0cf9885a9d","0350434d-ce5e-4526-b9a4-b9543e205d5b","569412a8-60a8-41ef-8bd0-d9154a25f002","b98203e9-72a8-4c09-968d-d4d2547ccda5","39d5eae2-f522-4705-98bf-c74d4c0cacbc","9eab8ab9-ba91-41f0-ac31-045ad1e00e9a","6904cf8e-f0e1-4e1c-bdfc-242d55f77324","efede8fe-9c15-4ab9-8550-f44c1eda8e89","8c71cd8f-ca15-48ae-afb6-fe85de9e1d39","9a494394-cdcb-4c89-b39f-d9716418e43e"],"content":[{"id":"cd339060-773e-43db-8788-d767b01ca0cb","type":"text","parent_id":"c12eb519-8872-4d46-93a1-2b65a4e718d5","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"27cba1a7-e764-4963-b67e-360b79efd5b5","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 0:01","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 0:01"]]},"parent_id":"c12eb519-8872-4d46-93a1-2b65a4e718d5","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 0:01\n\n"]},{"id":"52652128-5a30-4916-85d1-6e7b9c7705e4","type":"text","value":"Hello, everyone is Dennis nalli back again with another video.

Because it is very important to understand what I did in that previous video for you to be able to understand and interpret the result we are going to see here. So just to recap, in that previous video, all I did was to conduct 10 for serial dilution of a phage in SM buffer, and then supported 10 microliters. of the serially diluted phage on a lawn of a bacterium, I cultured the whole setup in 37 degrees centigrade overnight. And now I'm going to check the plates. So this is the plate. And if you remember the plate, I divided it into eight different sections. And as you can see, you can see Clarence on the lawn, so around the area where I did not sport, you would see cloudiness. And this just shows the bacteria has grown. So this is the first thing you want to look for. Because if you don't have a good loan, you will not have a good spot test because there will be no bacteria for your phage to infect so you can see the zone of clearance. And you can see complete clearance from the minus one because you have more fish there are reduced clearance or plaques across till you got to the minus six. So this is a type of results you are expecting to see if you conduct your serial dilution correctly. So in my next video, I'm going to show you how I will calculate the plaque forming unit of these phage that I have just enumerated. I'll see you in that video.

subtitles Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory. In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.<br>So the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.<br>We have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.<br>phages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.<br>Here's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.<br>We accomplish this mission in two general programs. The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.<br>So these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.<br>From their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.<br>Our first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process. And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019. And we actually had participants from six different countries in West Africa that was hosted in Ghana. And then most recently, in January 2020. We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.<br>Let me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform. We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops. In the most recent East Africa workshop. They came from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, they represented 14 different institutions. And they came from all different levels within their careers, graduate students, technicians, research assistants, lecturers, professors, professors and government scientists. And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.<br>funders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible. So we're very grateful for this community involvement.<br>At this workshop, we had our three original instructors, Professor Martha cloaky, from the University of Leicester, in the UK, and Dr. Janet nali. Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching. This time we had Slav, mich new ski from the University of Warwick in the UK.<br>And the goals of each workshop are not only to learn phage biology and experimental techniques, but also this is really important to develop a network of phage researchers starting in the given region, East Africa or say Southeast Asia, and then helping to connect them to other researchers throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US are America and<br>the topics covered include phage, ecology, molecular biology, various models for studying how phages interact with their bacteria phage applications in agriculture, including both animals and crops, phage therapy, compassionate use cases as well as clinical trials. And then each of the instructors talks about their current area of phage research to give some very practical examples of how phages might be applied. We also try to help the participants of the workshop prepare to get funding for their phage product projects, and also how to engage with the public that might be with a few<br>consumers of their phage product, the regulatory authorities, whoever it may be,<br>to get the support, they'll need to get phages utilized in their country. And then we're constantly compiling collection of key scientific publications. And we discussed that many of those during the workshops.<br>So just to give you an idea, at the end of the first two week workshop, as I said, which was hosted in Uganda in 2017, we were able to successfully isolate some phages, we being the participants of the workshop with support from the instructors. And so here are some transmission electron microscope images, microscopic images of some of the phages that were isolated. We've named these all up for Uganda phage, to a through five B. These were originally isolated from a sewage plant outside Kampala, Uganda, pure originally purified in Uganda and then further characterized back in the UK. And all of these have been made available to the participants of the workshop. So it's exciting to see that within just two weeks, phages can begin to be isolated by these workshop participants.<br>I mentioned that the network develop and the development and the relationships is a really important part of this. And I'm highlighting this spend a few hours together in a sewage plant, and it's a very bonding experience. You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.<br>So let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.<br>Starting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.<br>Then after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And<br>then, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants. So they were either starting new projects or significantly modifying projects that they'd previously initiated, because they'd learned some key things from attending our workshop. There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.<br>Even more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.<br>And at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first<br>from all of the<br>workshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's<br>Just within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.<br>So now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.<br>Our intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries. And it's akin to this saying from Lao Tzu and Martha cookie first made this slide. If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. And so as Martha rewarded this, if you give a woman or man a phage, you may treat one infection. Teach a woman or man how to isolate phages and you may treat multiple infections caused by many different pathogens. And that's our goal and hope here. Thanks much.\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n","  &lt;a  rel=prefetch href=\"/lectures\" class=\"_button __cta __width-full _margin-top-2 _margin-bottom-none-i\"&gt;Explore our phage lectures&lt;/a&gt;\n\n"],"children":["d5994f1d-693d-44c5-bc6b-ae38859d28ff","04ab2ccd-b475-4528-8b74-34fd11acb1a8","e15810e1-b8af-42f8-98a1-b9f2b019d45e","fd9d7b53-b8c6-481e-8a84-b0e206168abd","3120190e-9616-442b-b80c-4bc40e1f6aae","0764e168-08d1-4391-80d5-c478e29d0772","9c79e99c-f3b6-4848-bf6e-62c93f3304af"],"content":[{"id":"d5994f1d-693d-44c5-bc6b-ae38859d28ff","type":"text","value":"Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!","properties":{"title":[["Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!"]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Welcome to Phages for Global Health Online!\n\n"]},{"id":"04ab2ccd-b475-4528-8b74-34fd11acb1a8","type":"text","parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"e15810e1-b8af-42f8-98a1-b9f2b019d45e","type":"text","value":"Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions.","properties":{"title":[["Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions."]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Please watch our welcome video, and when you're done, feel free to [browse our long list of free lectures](/lectures), [look at our phage library](/library), or sign up for an account if you want to keep track of your learning progress and join the discussions.\n\n"]},{"id":"fd9d7b53-b8c6-481e-8a84-b0e206168abd","type":"text","parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"3120190e-9616-442b-b80c-4bc40e1f6aae","type":"toggle","value":"Auto-generated Subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Auto-generated Subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"385f5f94-43db-4b58-8f5b-3939fcb660e1","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Auto-generated Subtitles</summary>\n\n","            Auto-generated video subtitles Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory. In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.<br>So the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.<br>We have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.<br>phages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.<br>Here's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.<br>We accomplish this mission in two general programs. The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.<br>So these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.<br>From their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.<br>Our first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process.

And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019.

We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops.

And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.\nfunders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible.

Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching.

And we discussed that many of those during the workshops.\nSo just to give you an idea, at the end of the first two week workshop, as I said, which was hosted in Uganda in 2017, we were able to successfully isolate some phages, we being the participants of the workshop with support from the instructors. And so here are some transmission electron microscope images, microscopic images of some of the phages that were isolated. We've named these all up for Uganda phage, to a through five B. These were originally isolated from a sewage plant outside Kampala, Uganda, pure originally purified in Uganda and then further characterized back in the UK. And all of these have been made available to the participants of the workshop. So it's exciting to see that within just two weeks, phages can begin to be isolated by these workshop participants.\nI mentioned that the network develop and the development and the relationships is a really important part of this. And I'm highlighting this spend a few hours together in a sewage plant, and it's a very bonding experience. You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.\nSo let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.\nStarting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.\nThen after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And\nthen, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants. So they were either starting new projects or significantly modifying projects that they'd previously initiated, because they'd learned some key things from attending our workshop. There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.\nEven more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.\nAnd at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first\nfrom all of the\nworkshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's\nJust within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.\nSo now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.\nOur intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries. And it's akin to this saying from Lao Tzu and Martha cookie first made this slide. If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. And so as Martha rewarded this, if you give a woman or man a phage, you may treat one infection. Teach a woman or man how to isolate phages and you may treat multiple infections caused by many different pathogens. And that's our goal and hope here. Thanks much.","properties":{"title":[["Auto-generated video subtitles Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory. In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.\nSo the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.\nWe have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.\nphages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.\nHere's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.\nWe accomplish this mission in two general programs. The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.\nSo these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.\nFrom their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.\nOur first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process. And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019. And we actually had participants from six different countries in West Africa that was hosted in Ghana. And then most recently, in January 2020. We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.\nLet me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform. We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops. In the most recent East Africa workshop. They came from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, they represented 14 different institutions. And they came from all different levels within their careers, graduate students, technicians, research assistants, lecturers, professors, professors and government scientists. And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.\nfunders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible. So we're very grateful for this community involvement.\nAt this workshop, we had our three original instructors, Professor Martha cloaky, from the University of Leicester, in the UK, and Dr. Janet nali. Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching. This time we had Slav, mich new ski from the University of Warwick in the UK.\nAnd the goals of each workshop are not only to learn phage biology and experimental techniques, but also this is really important to develop a network of phage researchers starting in the given region, East Africa or say Southeast Asia, and then helping to connect them to other researchers throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US are America and\nthe topics covered include phage, ecology, molecular biology, various models for studying how phages interact with their bacteria phage applications in agriculture, including both animals and crops, phage therapy, compassionate use cases as well as clinical trials. And then each of the instructors talks about their current area of phage research to give some very practical examples of how phages might be applied. We also try to help the participants of the workshop prepare to get funding for their phage product projects, and also how to engage with the public that might be with a few\nconsumers of their phage product, the regulatory authorities, whoever it may be,\nto get the support, they'll need to get phages utilized in their country.

I am Dr. Shawna MacAllan. And I am a phage and clinical researcher here at the bogus University Hospital in Zurich. And I'm happy to be one of the lecturers in this online course series for phages. And today we're going to be talking about my favorite topic, which are clinical trials for phage therapy. And to start off with, I'd like to ask you a question. And that is, why would you take this medicine? So here you can see it's a bottle of aspirin, it's probably something that we've all come across and needed in our lifetimes and anti inflammatory and it's commonplace everywhere, across the world. So if you've answered yes to this question, I want to ask you, would you take this medicine, this is the Pio bacteriophage cocktail produced by elliana in Tbilisi, Georgia. So it is a registered medicine or product in Georgia, and it's sold as an over the counter medicine in the pharmacy. And when you look at these two different products, start to think about what makes you say, Okay, I'll take a pill of aspirin, and maybe might make you hesitate before you would take Pio bacteria phages. And that's really what we want to go through today is to look at why we do clinical trials, because this is what we need in order to bring a product to market.\n\n","    And in order to understand why we do them,\n\n","    we're going to have to briefly look at how they came about through history and where this idea of performing experiments on humans, rather than a test tube or on animals came about.\n\n","    Then we'll move on to when we do a\n\n","    clinical trial, what are the main different parts of a clinical study, before we actually move into the modern trials for phage therapy that have been performed to date. And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics. And in order to understand why we do clinical trials, it's really useful that we look at how drug development occurs. So a lot of what we think about for phage therapy phage experiments is really more this discovery phase where we have a great idea or a problem that needs solving. And we look at this problem or interesting idea through basic research, to in vitro tests in vivo tests. And we usually do this at the university or institutional level. But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.\n\n","    And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations. And depending on where you want to use that drug, you should can take into consideration what the local regulatory authorities are. And Tanzania, which is where we did our last in person lecture series was really impressive, because Tanzania is the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning and regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the w h o. And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market. So they control the access in of drugs into the market. But they also make sure that the drugs that are there are still functioning and safe. And they're still post surveillance studies that are performed even once a drug has a regulatory authorization. And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant. There is another few issues actually that have to do with introducing bias into the way that they structured this investigation is that there was no randomization. So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time. And lastly, but not all. One of the other issues is that this investigation was not blinded. So normally with a clinical trial, we really try not to know, either from the perspective of the patient, or if the treating physician what your patient is actually receiving if they're getting a placebo or the standard of care, or if they're getting the investigational product.\n\n","    And this is ultimately because we have a tendency to introduce biases, maybe you could treat a patient better than another or some way differently if you knew what you were giving them within the clinical trial. And this could really bias your results. Now, where clinical trials really developed was out of, you know, the devastation of World War Two. So this was, unfortunately, during this time, with the Nazi occupation, Nazi concentration camps, there was extreme inhumane experimentation performed on humans. And this really led to the development of ethical codes for how we have to work with patients, ethically, to ensure their dignity, and their well being and their freedom of choice. So this led to a variety of different legislations that have been adopted in various forums across the world, notably the Nuremberg Code, and the Helsinki declaration, that has really improved the way that we treat patients that are part of clinical trials. And overall, what this has led to is that when you perform a clinical trial, not only do you have to have the ethical committee or the regulatory authorities involved, you also to have to have an ethical Committee, which will look at the structure of your study, and possibly do some monitoring of the study to ensure that the patients are treated the way that they should be. And they're, they're ethically treated. And this also means that when we involve any type of human subjects in clinical research, where we make sure that we get informed consent, so that they are aware of what the study is, what they could happen to them, and that they have the right to withdrawal from the study at any point in time, for any reason. And there's also the idea that now patients as well, we have to go to great lengths to anonymize their data and protect their privacy.\n\n","    So really,\n\n","    as time goes on, we see a progression of clinical trials and how we did them. And one of the first randomized clinical trials, or the first actually comes from 1948. And in line with phage therapy, this also also has to do with bacterial infections. And so the first randomized clinical trial was actually investigating the use of structure myosin, to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and this was published in the British Medical Journal. And it was really, really remarkable because through this trial, they were able to show that when you treated with that strep demise, and only 7% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis die, whereas without step two minds and almost one third or 20% of the control patients, they they passed away. So again, that idea of introducing randomization is a way to reduce bias in your clinical trial and to have a greater trust in the data that you produce. So this concludes the first section and I will pick back up with you shortly where we look into the next sections of clinical trials for phage therapy.

But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.\n\n","    And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations. And depending on where you want to use that drug, you should can take into consideration what the local regulatory authorities are. And Tanzania, which is where we did our last in person lecture series was really impressive, because Tanzania is the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning and regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the w h o. And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market. So they control the access in of drugs into the market. But they also make sure that the drugs that are there are still functioning and safe. And they're still post surveillance studies that are performed even once a drug has a regulatory authorization. And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant. There is another few issues actually that have to do with introducing bias into the way that they structured this investigation is that there was no randomization. So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time. And lastly, but not all. One of the other issues is that this investigation was not blinded. So normally with a clinical trial, we really try not to know, either from the perspective of the patient, or if the treating physician what your patient is actually receiving if they're getting a placebo or the standard of care, or if they're getting the investigational product.\n\n","    And this is ultimately because we have a tendency to introduce biases, maybe you could treat a patient better than another or some way differently if you knew what you were giving them within the clinical trial. And this could really bias your results. Now, where clinical trials really developed was out of, you know, the devastation of World War Two. So this was, unfortunately, during this time, with the Nazi occupation, Nazi concentration camps, there was extreme inhumane experimentation performed on humans. And this really led to the development of ethical codes for how we have to work with patients, ethically, to ensure their dignity, and their well being and their freedom of choice. So this led to a variety of different legislations that have been adopted in various forums across the world, notably the Nuremberg Code, and the Helsinki declaration, that has really improved the way that we treat patients that are part of clinical trials. And overall, what this has led to is that when you perform a clinical trial, not only do you have to have the ethical committee or the regulatory authorities involved, you also to have to have an ethical Committee, which will look at the structure of your study, and possibly do some monitoring of the study to ensure that the patients are treated the way that they should be. And they're, they're ethically treated. And this also means that when we involve any type of human subjects in clinical research, where we make sure that we get informed consent, so that they are aware of what the study is, what they could happen to them, and that they have the right to withdrawal from the study at any point in time, for any reason. And there's also the idea that now patients as well, we have to go to great lengths to anonymize their data and protect their privacy.\n\n","    So really,\n\n","    as time goes on, we see a progression of clinical trials and how we did them. And one of the first randomized clinical trials, or the first actually comes from 1948. And in line with phage therapy, this also also has to do with bacterial infections. And so the first randomized clinical trial was actually investigating the use of structure myosin, to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and this was published in the British Medical Journal. And it was really, really remarkable because through this trial, they were able to show that when you treated with that strep demise, and only 7% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis die, whereas without step two minds and almost one third or 20% of the control patients, they they passed away. So again, that idea of introducing randomization is a way to reduce bias in your clinical trial and to have a greater trust in the data that you produce. So this concludes the first section and I will pick back up with you shortly where we look into the next sections of clinical trials for phage therapy.

And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics.

And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant. There is another few issues actually that have to do with introducing bias into the way that they structured this investigation is that there was no randomization. So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time. And lastly, but not all. One of the other issues is that this investigation was not blinded. So normally with a clinical trial, we really try not to know, either from the perspective of the patient, or if the treating physician what your patient is actually receiving if they're getting a placebo or the standard of care, or if they're getting the investigational product."]]},"parent_id":"0453aed8-3178-4a34-a82c-6b4359279a68","parent_table":"block","markdown":["And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations.

And we are back for the second segment of this lecture on clinical trials for phage therapy. And we've just gotten done, speaking about the first parts of why we do clinical trials and also about some of the historical events that have really shaped clinical research today. Now, I'd like to move on and show you some of the main parts of a clinical study, because clinical research is quite different than what we're used to doing in a lab per se. So one of the things is that\n\n","    you have\n\n","    to first define your research question. And the idea is you have a research question in order to address a problem or missing piece of information and afield. So, particularly for phage therapy, our problem is really dealing with antibiotic resistance, or treatment failures for infectious disease. And then with the research question, we want to be able to test a possible solution. And in our case, this is bacteria phages. So an example of a research question would be something like can bacteriophages treat urinary tract infections, infections caused by multi drug resistant bacteria. And we'll see that even this is a little bit broad, and you should start with an idea like this, and then make it even more finer. finer is one of those great acronyms we use to try to guide and structure our research question. So find R stands for F meaning feasible, I meaning interesting, and being novel, ie ethical, we saw earlier that that's very important. And our that is relevant. So you can go through after you've come up with a research question to make sure it kind of ticks all of these boxes as of finer. So if we take the title of this\n\n","    publication, and\n\n","    we try to go through and pick out the Pico characteristics of the study, first we have so who is the population the key and key code, then who are we treating in this, this trial is urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. So that's the population that the study was targeting. Then in terms of the intra intervention, it's intra vesicle bacteriophages. Then for the control, it says in the title, it's placebo controlled, you'll have to read the study to find out what placebo was, then for the outcome, then its treatment. So they're really looking at the ability to treat urinary tract infections. And then if we look at the T, the type of study it is a double blind clinical trial. And I would say they could even gone further and indicated the phase of the study in this case, it would have been a phase two clinical trial.\n\n","    And when we look to design\n\n","    a study, first thing is we want to make sure that the trial is randomized, meaning that when a patient comes in, you don't know which of the treatment arms they'd be allocated to. So there's usually a whole system on how to randomize or a randomizing code. So it's not like the first 10 patients get the intervention. And then the next 10 patients get the placebo, or all of your patients starting with the first letter M get the intervention is usually a much more sophisticated and unpredictable system of deciding which patient gets which treatment. Another aspect for clinical trial design is that the study should be blinded, meaning that you should look at who actually knows who's getting what. So we could do a single blinded trial where only the patient doesn't know if what they're getting, you could do a double blinded trial where the physician, both the treating physician and the patient don't know what they're they're getting or administrating. Or depending on the design of the trial, you could also do a triple blinded saying, you know, maybe it's the person who prepares the medicines\n\n","    or\n\n","    something like that, you can either blind the study further. Then another important aspect is the control arm so you can't just you know, treat all of the patients with phages and then say okay, well this many, they their urinary tract infection got better, you have to be able to compare it to something. So in some instances, depending on the clinical indication, you would compare it to the standard of care that might be antibiotics or an answer my question We'll cream and other instances it would be a placebo. And that really depends on how the indication you're looking at is currently treated and what is ethical. And these three factors are these three things to design into the structure of a clinical trial are really important ways to reduce\n\n","    bias.\n\n","    So reduce sort of trying to structure your study in a way that will influence the final outcome. And then lastly, one other important aspect, super important aspect of a clinical trial is your expected effect. So the way that we judge if a clinical trial is a success or a failure is by looking at the primary outcome. So this is really your bottom line, what is the most important criteria that you are using or you're looking at in a clinical trial, and this is usually something when you're looking at advocacy is it's very patient centric, you know, if phages can make the bacteria go down, that's great. But if your patient still isn't feeling better, then ultimately, you wouldn't use phages in order to treat an infection. So usually, you want to have a primary outcome that is really centered around the patient. But then you can also design into the structure of a clinical trial, secondary outcomes. And this is usually where we add in aspects of microbiology, which is important for phages. Okay, an overall goal of a clinical trial is to obtain a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparing. So between, say, phages, and antibiotics or phages, and placebo, and the way that you judge that is through your primary outcome measure, and then P value of that difference. So the magical p value is really the statistical measure, then that will tell you if based off of all the the analysis you've done, if what you're looking at is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely that the outcome you are looking at is due to due to Chancellor. And my screen\n\n","    is pressing again,\n\n","    there we go.\n\n","    So another criteria, and when you're looking at a clinical trial to make sure that whatever it's saying is really sound is that studying the product safe, that there are no major biases that were introduced in the design of the study. So we saw randomization, blinding and comparatives, that the appropriate measures were taken, and super important for clinical trials are is that you used enough patience, that the intervention and the control were tested on enough people. So we'll see in a little bit that many of the clinical trials today for phage therapy involve a very few amount of patients. And when you don't have enough patients, it's difficult to know if what you're seeing is just due to chance, or if it's really something significant. And now the outcome is of a trial really affect what happens next. So if you can have a phase of a trial, say a phase one trial, and it shouldn't be safe, and then you would be allowed to progress into phase two studies. Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n","    And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem. I'm assuming if you're interested in phages, and phage therapy, then you're aware of this. But when we look back, even 3030 or 40 years ago, we would have a certain number of new antibacterial agents that were approved every year. So we're thinking, you know, back in the early 1980s, or 1980s, were up to 16 new drugs per year still being developed and approved for treating bacterial infections. Whereas now, you look down to the most recent data in this graph from 2008 to 2012. And that's maybe one or two. So that coupled with increasing costs for developing new medicines. Now they estimate that almost 400 and 60 million US dollars are required to go from, you know, when you have that bright idea to getting your authorizations, it's almost 500 million US dollars. And that is just an insane amount of money, especially when we're talking about infectious disease. You couple all of this, with the fact that time is really running out on the utility, we have antibiotics, and new alternatives are desperately needed. So if we look at how this relates a little bit to phage therapy, we've gone through the different studies. So we haven't talked before about phase zero. This is an observational study, which I would highly recommend, especially for phage based trials, because that's where you really look at your baseline demographics of a patient population. So in the incidence of urinary tract infections, for example, you would look to see which pathogens are causing the infection, look at the different strains and maybe their sensitivity to phages. Now, the phases one through four are really when you're in patience, and then this goes up in the probably the cost, but also the amount of patience, and then the different goals that you have for each of the phases. And really, the golden would you say the golden ticket is to get a successful phase three trial where you can obtain a marketing authorization. And now there's been a number shown here in these these small orange arrows of phase one safety studies that have been done with phage products. So if you look through the literature, there's quite a few of phase one trials and to date, there's been no phase one studies that have associated phage products with any type of safety concern. And then there's a few trials that now you can see in the slightly bolder orange arrows that are completed phase two trials. So this is really where they're looking for early signs of efficacy.

And we are back for the second segment of this lecture on clinical trials for phage therapy. And we've just gotten done, speaking about the first parts of why we do clinical trials and also about some of the historical events that have really shaped clinical research today. Now, I'd like to move on and show you some of the main parts of a clinical study, because clinical research is quite different than what we're used to doing in a lab per se. So one of the things is that\n\n","    you have\n\n","    to first define your research question. And the idea is you have a research question in order to address a problem or missing piece of information and afield. So, particularly for phage therapy, our problem is really dealing with antibiotic resistance, or treatment failures for infectious disease. And then with the research question, we want to be able to test a possible solution. And in our case, this is bacteria phages. So an example of a research question would be something like can bacteriophages treat urinary tract infections, infections caused by multi drug resistant bacteria. And we'll see that even this is a little bit broad, and you should start with an idea like this, and then make it even more finer. finer is one of those great acronyms we use to try to guide and structure our research question. So find R stands for F meaning feasible, I meaning interesting, and being novel, ie ethical, we saw earlier that that's very important. And our that is relevant. So you can go through after you've come up with a research question to make sure it kind of ticks all of these boxes as of finer. So if we take the title of this\n\n","    publication, and\n\n","    we try to go through and pick out the Pico characteristics of the study, first we have so who is the population the key and key code, then who are we treating in this, this trial is urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. So that's the population that the study was targeting. Then in terms of the intra intervention, it's intra vesicle bacteriophages. Then for the control, it says in the title, it's placebo controlled, you'll have to read the study to find out what placebo was, then for the outcome, then its treatment. So they're really looking at the ability to treat urinary tract infections. And then if we look at the T, the type of study it is a double blind clinical trial. And I would say they could even gone further and indicated the phase of the study in this case, it would have been a phase two clinical trial.\n\n","    And when we look to design\n\n","    a study, first thing is we want to make sure that the trial is randomized, meaning that when a patient comes in, you don't know which of the treatment arms they'd be allocated to. So there's usually a whole system on how to randomize or a randomizing code. So it's not like the first 10 patients get the intervention. And then the next 10 patients get the placebo, or all of your patients starting with the first letter M get the intervention is usually a much more sophisticated and unpredictable system of deciding which patient gets which treatment. Another aspect for clinical trial design is that the study should be blinded, meaning that you should look at who actually knows who's getting what. So we could do a single blinded trial where only the patient doesn't know if what they're getting, you could do a double blinded trial where the physician, both the treating physician and the patient don't know what they're they're getting or administrating. Or depending on the design of the trial, you could also do a triple blinded saying, you know, maybe it's the person who prepares the medicines\n\n","    or\n\n","    something like that, you can either blind the study further. Then another important aspect is the control arm so you can't just you know, treat all of the patients with phages and then say okay, well this many, they their urinary tract infection got better, you have to be able to compare it to something. So in some instances, depending on the clinical indication, you would compare it to the standard of care that might be antibiotics or an answer my question We'll cream and other instances it would be a placebo. And that really depends on how the indication you're looking at is currently treated and what is ethical. And these three factors are these three things to design into the structure of a clinical trial are really important ways to reduce\n\n","    bias.\n\n","    So reduce sort of trying to structure your study in a way that will influence the final outcome. And then lastly, one other important aspect, super important aspect of a clinical trial is your expected effect. So the way that we judge if a clinical trial is a success or a failure is by looking at the primary outcome. So this is really your bottom line, what is the most important criteria that you are using or you're looking at in a clinical trial, and this is usually something when you're looking at advocacy is it's very patient centric, you know, if phages can make the bacteria go down, that's great. But if your patient still isn't feeling better, then ultimately, you wouldn't use phages in order to treat an infection. So usually, you want to have a primary outcome that is really centered around the patient. But then you can also design into the structure of a clinical trial, secondary outcomes. And this is usually where we add in aspects of microbiology, which is important for phages. Okay, an overall goal of a clinical trial is to obtain a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparing. So between, say, phages, and antibiotics or phages, and placebo, and the way that you judge that is through your primary outcome measure, and then P value of that difference. So the magical p value is really the statistical measure, then that will tell you if based off of all the the analysis you've done, if what you're looking at is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely that the outcome you are looking at is due to due to Chancellor. And my screen\n\n","    is pressing again,\n\n","    there we go.\n\n","    So another criteria, and when you're looking at a clinical trial to make sure that whatever it's saying is really sound is that studying the product safe, that there are no major biases that were introduced in the design of the study. So we saw randomization, blinding and comparatives, that the appropriate measures were taken, and super important for clinical trials are is that you used enough patience, that the intervention and the control were tested on enough people. So we'll see in a little bit that many of the clinical trials today for phage therapy involve a very few amount of patients. And when you don't have enough patients, it's difficult to know if what you're seeing is just due to chance, or if it's really something significant. And now the outcome is of a trial really affect what happens next. So if you can have a phase of a trial, say a phase one trial, and it shouldn't be safe, and then you would be allowed to progress into phase two studies. Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n","    And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem. I'm assuming if you're interested in phages, and phage therapy, then you're aware of this. But when we look back, even 3030 or 40 years ago, we would have a certain number of new antibacterial agents that were approved every year. So we're thinking, you know, back in the early 1980s, or 1980s, were up to 16 new drugs per year still being developed and approved for treating bacterial infections. Whereas now, you look down to the most recent data in this graph from 2008 to 2012. And that's maybe one or two. So that coupled with increasing costs for developing new medicines. Now they estimate that almost 400 and 60 million US dollars are required to go from, you know, when you have that bright idea to getting your authorizations, it's almost 500 million US dollars. And that is just an insane amount of money, especially when we're talking about infectious disease. You couple all of this, with the fact that time is really running out on the utility, we have antibiotics, and new alternatives are desperately needed. So if we look at how this relates a little bit to phage therapy, we've gone through the different studies. So we haven't talked before about phase zero. This is an observational study, which I would highly recommend, especially for phage based trials, because that's where you really look at your baseline demographics of a patient population. So in the incidence of urinary tract infections, for example, you would look to see which pathogens are causing the infection, look at the different strains and maybe their sensitivity to phages. Now, the phases one through four are really when you're in patience, and then this goes up in the probably the cost, but also the amount of patience, and then the different goals that you have for each of the phases. And really, the golden would you say the golden ticket is to get a successful phase three trial where you can obtain a marketing authorization. And now there's been a number shown here in these these small orange arrows of phase one safety studies that have been done with phage products. So if you look through the literature, there's quite a few of phase one trials and to date, there's been no phase one studies that have associated phage products with any type of safety concern. And then there's a few trials that now you can see in the slightly bolder orange arrows that are completed phase two trials. So this is really where they're looking for early signs of efficacy. And now that's what we're going to talk about in the next section after this short break is looking at the for phase two click clinical trials for phage therapy that have been completed today. Alright, see you in a little bit.

And then lastly, one other important aspect, super important aspect of a clinical trial is your expected effect. So the way that we judge if a clinical trial is a success or a failure is by looking at the primary outcome. So this is really your bottom line, what is the most important criteria that you are using or you're looking at in a clinical trial, and this is usually something when you're looking at advocacy is it's very patient centric, you know, if phages can make the bacteria go down, that's great. But if your patient still isn't feeling better, then ultimately, you wouldn't use phages in order to treat an infection. So usually, you want to have a primary outcome that is really centered around the patient. But then you can also design into the structure of a clinical trial, secondary outcomes. And this is usually where we add in aspects of microbiology, which is important for phages.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures. Bye\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["ad44d67b-f87a-437d-bf59-c7de735ac9fc","c56cadd1-0511-4990-89b4-22d80e53c174","27dd6897-7197-4c8e-afb0-9b6175f5c004","c3d2454b-0c12-4cfc-b2b1-302aac089b1c","2badb935-1e2a-4850-9a23-337833fc5542","9b5c24fb-6ea5-492c-9a69-96f7d133ebda","93375d49-2d1b-4712-8d35-f70993f50085","b6a1340d-2790-47c0-989e-02b605175583","8e4b871f-44ea-4da3-ae69-21c97dc29ca0","530f513b-9d42-4100-a3d5-fa79a6359a52","e0b862b8-82ae-4980-9164-d5e8100ea1fa","e16b84a6-c108-454e-8e5c-8959c9627d32","b0ac5246-e81a-4fb4-9bb9-73102db1c77a","ad4a2a4f-5837-463c-ba1a-3a0bf23f5566","97414f59-e2d9-4533-b4b6-ea12685d1cc1","362e210a-a46a-47fd-a543-d9caeeaff788","0fbb91e6-43ca-4ceb-a7b7-6f894bbc5284","30530336-79c1-4165-8ee4-96e011e11220","4c018842-b6c3-49ff-bd2e-1b4180385056","57da1d5c-d431-4f4a-95a8-4c88a95ac70e","81e08935-c759-4498-b1de-9defdc6d679b","77407d78-60a3-4336-9ea8-666bde91bc45","937e1724-70f7-43a2-bbe8-2d1af556ce2c","93d103d8-a94a-470e-b6bf-7e54ae07796a","36812216-6e9d-4249-8017-16c81ae10851","ccb918b0-ddcf-4be9-85d6-f13e9b480723","9d4e36b4-d094-42af-bba0-494abee48b2a","f1a3842d-636f-4606-baea-95438704abc7","7cb73522-def7-4e2f-a49a-47a74b6acbdf","e2b7d2cd-692e-403f-8926-08887931acef","3f03702f-a3f3-4f97-a4fc-30860d92e55a","d798d448-48de-40f0-b27c-56692e69c2e4","cd6c7293-0826-42b7-81e8-0a15816e9f6d","8fae216b-d431-4e76-9d63-435ed16cbe3d","be9aeaf4-0958-49d7-9409-9c6fbd607b04","0c8a4bf1-078d-4ae2-8abc-cddabd19e6b5","1a00d7f7-8399-4832-bf70-246cd94c931c","e49c4ce5-26e8-497c-99b2-7fb5ecce1cb9","f9e2191c-aeeb-44ea-822e-4777dad5aa91","37ccd2fc-d77d-4e3f-8675-b10f85a10a8a","ac9eb5b6-3cc1-469c-8466-3c21f6ee2475","178ee923-e5b7-4d7d-a2c4-347bdaabbcea","84ad5f07-5516-469b-a630-750dd5a70207","e619c631-15d6-4afd-bd2b-b049c84ac9e7","b009b4e3-96f7-42c4-882e-c7037eb82a51","ec174a90-80c5-4c14-880c-42d9ec2af6d2","da737d43-28c4-4984-bc6c-ed96265a498c","634023e3-0ea7-404e-8602-0591b65abb05","8f0482cf-45bd-48a4-a568-11c074df069e","303fd9d8-887a-4826-8c91-983a9f7772f4","f70c3ad5-8c6c-4cf5-8f7f-244c32be5500","d20f2176-3be9-4a83-adfc-b6b561015a0e","268670f8-9c2e-447b-9cf0-0b8bed22ad94","57756f19-8737-4c22-906a-25ec3b85a95e","5fa48b42-a3bd-4e93-a201-c01a1aeee19d","6f46eb00-a1b0-4ff1-b218-4aa15c5e05ab","6045d0aa-268c-4c95-9c18-f95c2c069349","2026fd64-1a2d-4664-83ca-9fd49f984679","2ab7d057-b4a3-44c6-8891-cb43936e9d7a","b3981bec-8ab4-497c-8328-9783a1efdfad","9530b143-013d-4e5b-9444-70a32d0ca737","a4f10f25-adb2-4e7f-8e38-9e8472d998f2","78438a91-a87b-4031-bf0c-fcdc9f1764df","1f4d9875-de3c-4eaa-aec1-493e3ac66691","97544024-17d2-4e16-bb21-1a79479837b1","4b2e140a-40cd-47c0-871f-66296ea183ca","40da93ae-a200-4d8e-a7a6-b5265bf5817b","eec606c6-9acd-450c-b3b0-9791bef41d75","4eaed270-e34e-4ff3-a184-b97f34003f81","c568a5f6-370b-4710-ac0d-2fc02b3f3a17","f0e02cbe-b48d-4205-af53-1ab7f8928fd1","4c6f38f3-a14b-474f-8f1c-2e60d8a52503"],"content":[{"id":"ad44d67b-f87a-437d-bf59-c7de735ac9fc","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 0:00","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 0:00"]]},"parent_id":"967082ba-8a3a-4eb8-ae6f-45d8de4d2bb4","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 0:00\n\n"]},{"id":"c56cadd1-0511-4990-89b4-22d80e53c174","type":"text","value":"Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen.

So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials. Now when we look at how this falls into development for antimicrobial therapy, we know that since the 1980s, the number of new antibacterial agents being discovered and developed is drastically decreasing. So here you can see that there were about 16 new agents that were discovered in the 1980s. And then we have as few as two between 2008 and 2012. Now this is partially due to the fact that clinical trials are extremely expensive. So here you can see that the estimate is you know, 400 and $60 million. If you want to believe During a clinical drug to market, and this is just something that's extremely difficult to do. And unfortunately, antibiotics are not something that drug companies can then make a lot of money out of. So they have less of an inherent motivation to put money into a clinical trial, because they have less ability to get money back out of the drug being authorized itself. And we put this into the context of antimicrobial resistance. And we realize that we're really on the clock here, in order to develop new anti microbial therapies in order to address the problems that we're seeing with antibiotic failures. Now, we've touched a little bit here and there about the different phases of clinical trials from zero to four. And when we start at zero, this is usually just an observational study. So this is when you're not applying any type of product to a patient, you're just simply trying to look and see what the demographics or the epidemiology of your target population is. And then you can move on to safety. So this is phase one. And we said earlier that traditionally, this is done in healthy subjects. So you would be putting your product or your phages into a healthy person, and just making sure that when everything else is going well, that the drug product itself isn't causing any adverse effects. And then phase two is we're still of course, considering safety, we always consider safety. But this is when we start to look at efficacy, because now we're normally in a patient population that is afflicted by the\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:43\n\n","    the condition that we're trying to treat. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:46\n\n","    then once we move into phase three, this is really where we're trying to decide or to determine if the product is effective for treating a specific condition or not. And you have a larger population size than what you did in phase two trials. Now, it's at this point that after the completion, the successful completion of a phase three trial, that it would be possible to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. And this is really again, what companies really try to do with their drugs is because once they obtain a marketing authorization, and they're able to sell, sell, distribute and treat patients, but even after a drug or a product receives a marketing authorization, they're still phase four studies. So this is called post marketing surveillance studies. And this is when it's still\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:41\n\n","    required that the company would then follow patients who are receiving this drug over a longer amount of time to make sure that there's no adverse effects that develop on a larger scale. And we when we look at the different phases, in terms of what's been done for phage therapy, there's been a number of different phase one trials done to determine safety. And this is this will cover different types of infections. And we'll cover healthy volunteers as well as some even some patients. And this will cover a lot of different products from something as you know, as simple as a single phage, something as complex as maybe 10 or 12 pages or so there's been a number of these phase one studies done. And there's also been several efficacy studies. So these are the phase two studies that have already been completed.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:33\n\n","    And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:35\n\n","    this is really where the next section we're going to delve into these four phase two trials that have been completed for phage therapy. And if you want to have a little look and read deeper into the literature, I'll just tell you here now before we take a break, the four different publications that we'll discuss more in detail. So the first one was by right and all in 2009. And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy. Now, the second trial that was published was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to Cali phage preparations and a randomized control trial and children from Bangladesh. This was published by sarker and all in 2016. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:32\n\n","    then a third trial we have\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:34\n\n","    was the Fagor burn trial if you've ever heard of that, this is the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial This was published by jolt and all in 2019 in The Lancet, and very recently, in a trial that I was involved with was the intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer through a resection of the prostate, a randomized placebo controlled double blind trial. So all of them have these, you know, very long and complex titles. So if you're interested, you can take the time to read them individually. And I would suggest trying to look at the titles and pick out this Pico information. So the population outcome control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:29\n\n","    P. control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:33\n\n","    those letters that we talked about earlier, you can come back and look at them, but just have a look at the title. And go through and see if you can pick out yourself all of that important information. And then now We'll take a short break and I'll see you hopefully in a little bit to go over each of them then\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n"],"children":["382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","209d8623-fef9-4522-8d88-90908c0fd758"],"content":[{"id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"f51a1bf0-adf2-422d-80ed-8808a5eb51eb","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n","    Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials. Now when we look at how this falls into development for antimicrobial therapy, we know that since the 1980s, the number of new antibacterial agents being discovered and developed is drastically decreasing. So here you can see that there were about 16 new agents that were discovered in the 1980s. And then we have as few as two between 2008 and 2012. Now this is partially due to the fact that clinical trials are extremely expensive. So here you can see that the estimate is you know, 400 and $60 million. If you want to believe During a clinical drug to market, and this is just something that's extremely difficult to do. And unfortunately, antibiotics are not something that drug companies can then make a lot of money out of. So they have less of an inherent motivation to put money into a clinical trial, because they have less ability to get money back out of the drug being authorized itself. And we put this into the context of antimicrobial resistance. And we realize that we're really on the clock here, in order to develop new anti microbial therapies in order to address the problems that we're seeing with antibiotic failures. Now, we've touched a little bit here and there about the different phases of clinical trials from zero to four. And when we start at zero, this is usually just an observational study. So this is when you're not applying any type of product to a patient, you're just simply trying to look and see what the demographics or the epidemiology of your target population is. And then you can move on to safety. So this is phase one. And we said earlier that traditionally, this is done in healthy subjects. So you would be putting your product or your phages into a healthy person, and just making sure that when everything else is going well, that the drug product itself isn't causing any adverse effects. And then phase two is we're still of course, considering safety, we always consider safety. But this is when we start to look at efficacy, because now we're normally in a patient population that is afflicted by the\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:43\n\n","    the condition that we're trying to treat. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:46\n\n","    then once we move into phase three, this is really where we're trying to decide or to determine if the product is effective for treating a specific condition or not. And you have a larger population size than what you did in phase two trials. Now, it's at this point that after the completion, the successful completion of a phase three trial, that it would be possible to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. And this is really again, what companies really try to do with their drugs is because once they obtain a marketing authorization, and they're able to sell, sell, distribute and treat patients, but even after a drug or a product receives a marketing authorization, they're still phase four studies. So this is called post marketing surveillance studies. And this is when it's still\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:41\n\n","    required that the company would then follow patients who are receiving this drug over a longer amount of time to make sure that there's no adverse effects that develop on a larger scale. And we when we look at the different phases, in terms of what's been done for phage therapy, there's been a number of different phase one trials done to determine safety. And this is this will cover different types of infections. And we'll cover healthy volunteers as well as some even some patients. And this will cover a lot of different products from something as you know, as simple as a single phage, something as complex as maybe 10 or 12 pages or so there's been a number of these phase one studies done. And there's also been several efficacy studies. So these are the phase two studies that have already been completed.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:33\n\n","    And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:35\n\n","    this is really where the next section we're going to delve into these four phase two trials that have been completed for phage therapy. And if you want to have a little look and read deeper into the literature, I'll just tell you here now before we take a break, the four different publications that we'll discuss more in detail. So the first one was by right and all in 2009. And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy. Now, the second trial that was published was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to Cali phage preparations and a randomized control trial and children from Bangladesh. This was published by sarker and all in 2016. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:32\n\n","    then a third trial we have\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:34\n\n","    was the Fagor burn trial if you've ever heard of that, this is the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial This was published by jolt and all in 2019 in The Lancet, and very recently, in a trial that I was involved with was the intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer through a resection of the prostate, a randomized placebo controlled double blind trial. So all of them have these, you know, very long and complex titles. So if you're interested, you can take the time to read them individually. And I would suggest trying to look at the titles and pick out this Pico information. So the population outcome control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:29\n\n","    P. control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:33\n\n","    those letters that we talked about earlier, you can come back and look at them, but just have a look at the title. And go through and see if you can pick out yourself all of that important information. And then now We'll take a short break and I'll see you hopefully in a little bit to go over each of them then\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["a2b12c9f-f8dc-4897-ab42-9e9c7de639a0","ff660b54-bc11-4ffb-bb2d-e1b4afd994af","9443a535-dc5b-473c-b107-34f8706ec083","46fe2fa7-1b50-4646-9142-ee8d50e5e315","f183f1e5-dcf2-46e4-ba0d-77839b52956c","462b5626-ea5e-40df-b655-c1a4cf70f623","4976a1be-c75d-4140-934c-9fa4df70febb","f0e5e1bd-eac9-447c-981d-1f3428c872eb","1c0a9ed2-dca5-4cc2-8c65-ccad444df608","08ef6ecb-895b-4c78-8916-eec8fdf971b0","54ac1e9d-ddb4-4337-9d01-b79cf9a6f52a","54f03b4f-275d-4153-9080-0e2b9e9fa731","5ce85b4d-634d-4a87-8f20-c50b13851842","2f71924a-34f1-4c5e-817d-4ad8e2dce4e1","df6d0a12-c871-4d2f-bb84-e2b91135c3b3","0beb4dc9-95e0-40b3-a78b-90a70a36f023","c6ac39bd-f79c-4846-80a9-7377ef4f3e9b","f1eafbf9-d41b-4368-9ed3-2278e31b2d90","a0be69ce-03ce-4eb3-a936-d81c8c600b33","a265875f-f804-450b-8a48-38f29bd2bca8","0eb34d40-998f-4a45-9c56-b29c24e46900","6f50b966-cd15-4b5e-9ce1-67a9cabb040d","bcc6abdc-86b2-4add-ab72-9640cd46dc4d","9e0f8946-623d-4581-97f7-f86fb6bdbce8","515c403d-c770-4174-bc2e-d1e76be56418","2300cb27-4623-417a-a694-5c2f93d32b1a","9483c553-5171-4b2a-bc4c-27a639e3226b","5270311e-693a-42cd-bf7e-b0be1f9809a7","e7feab48-f1e6-49c2-a1cc-eb061f4b820b","86a6984c-887a-47d8-b43d-1c9c30142553","000bedff-f926-4a9c-ae70-41764c172e14","0fc6fd65-bd3f-4876-b7c6-1f6b558c4488","9a711e3b-7b68-4022-974e-a1e4cc69d398","2d871c4f-9b97-4d3a-a237-625fa3deaba6","57218270-59b7-4fb5-ac71-105eff2712e3","749bcdbf-db71-46ea-be21-929b8b97a850"],"content":[{"id":"a2b12c9f-f8dc-4897-ab42-9e9c7de639a0","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 0:01","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 0:01"]]},"parent_id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n"]},{"id":"ff660b54-bc11-4ffb-bb2d-e1b4afd994af","type":"text","value":"Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.","properties":{"title":[["Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland.

And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.","properties":{"title":[["Now, why do we do clinical trials?

Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies."]]},"parent_id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site.

And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant.

Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection.

So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.","properties":{"title":[["And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable.

So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo.

And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy. Now, the second trial that was published was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to Cali phage preparations and a randomized control trial and children from Bangladesh. This was published by sarker and all in 2016.

\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:01\n\n","    Hello everyone, this is dr. john x nalli from the University of Leicester. The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here. The liquid I'm going to transfer is an SM buffer in a falcon tube I have got my P 1000 tips. Remember these will go with the p 1000 p pets. Now, I intend to transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer into the end of chip. So I'm going to take my P 1000 compact\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:31\n\n","    and I just the controller 250.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:35\n\n","    Remember I told you that the numbers on the controller is one digit short. So the 50 is 500 microliters of volume of whatever liquid I'm going to transfer.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:59\n\n","    I'm now going to press the plunger\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:03\n\n","    to the first stop\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:10\n\n","    and push the tip of the micropipette into one of the pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:21\n\n","    While the plunger is still down,\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:27\n\n","    I'm going to insert the tip\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:31\n\n","    just touching the SM buffer remember not to go beyond the pipette tip into whatever bottle or two that you are taking the material from. Once I release the plunger I have already aspirated the platform but microliters and by pressing back the plunger to the first stop, I will not release the material into the eppendorf tube. I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957.

The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here. The liquid I'm going to transfer is an SM buffer in a falcon tube I have got my P 1000 tips. Remember these will go with the p 1000 p pets. Now, I intend to transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer into the end of chip. So I'm going to take my P 1000 compact\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:31\n\n","    and I just the controller 250.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:35\n\n","    Remember I told you that the numbers on the controller is one digit short. So the 50 is 500 microliters of volume of whatever liquid I'm going to transfer.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:59\n\n","    I'm now going to press the plunger\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:03\n\n","    to the first stop\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:10\n\n","    and push the tip of the micropipette into one of the pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:21\n\n","    While the plunger is still down,\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:27\n\n","    I'm going to insert the tip\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:31\n\n","    just touching the SM buffer remember not to go beyond the pipette tip into whatever bottle or two that you are taking the material from. Once I release the plunger I have already aspirated the platform but microliters and by pressing back the plunger to the first stop, I will not release the material into the eppendorf tube. I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957. And I've also clearly demonstrated to you how you can use the micropipette to transport liquids from one container to the other. I hope this video is useful for you and help you in your microbiology research.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame. So this is me now just opening a pipette tip on the burner. And now I'm going to pour a medium into the plate. So I've got my medium which is hot and I'm now going to pour it into the plate I need to keep the plates as close to the fire as possible and the bottle as well. Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing. So whatever has descended on the tip of the bottle need to be sterilized. Now I'm going to show you how I'm going to strip out bacteria. This is a Staphylococcus aureus culture on a blue plate. And I'm going to transfer that to a stereo plate that I've just prepared. Now this plate is all set. So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200. And then you can use that micropipette on the P 200. Tip. Good.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:31\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you my diluent which is going to be assemble for you can use water in this case for your crystal violet, because what we'll be diluting is 1% crystal violates and this will just help to show the graduation or the reduction of the dilution as we go down the tubes. So I'm just opening the tube now. And I am working within a class to safety cabinet. That's why I don't have a flame with me. Now I've taken my P 1000, which is such to 900 microliters capacity. Now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tip. Now I'm going to take one tip. And I'm going to transfer. As I've shown you in my initial video, you have to press the plunger to the first stop. And now I'm going to add the quote. Now 900 microliters of my di D went into the tubes, I have to add this same quantity to all the tubes 900 microliters, of diluent. And as I've said, I'm using SM buffer. But if you do not want to waste your material, you can equally use water to dilute your crystal violet. But if you're diluting your phage, you will need to use assemble for and as you can see, I'm only allowing just the end of the tip to go into the tube do not exceed that because the only sterile part of the pipette is actually the tip. So now I'm going to put the P 1000. aside and close the eppendorf tubes containing my diluent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 7:10\n\n","    All of these contain my daily but not I'm going to pick the crystal violet that I hope to dilute and is going to be 10 for dilution, because each tube is daily diluted a tenfold to the next two. So this is the P 200 tips, which will go with my P 100. I'm going to pick a to a tip Sorry, I'm going to press it to the first plunger. Do not exceed that, or else you're going to take excess amount. So I'm now open my crystal violet. And I'm going to add that to the first tube which is the minus one tube. I'm going to resuspend that couple of time. And I'm going to throw away that pipette tip. After discarding, I will take a fresh tip and transfer material from the minus one\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 8:26\n\n","    tube\n\n","    Janet Nale 8:34\n\n","    into the minus two tube. And I'm going to resuspend that by putting up and down a couple of times to resuspend. And to equally distribute the crystal violet. I've discarded the initial tip and picked a fresh one. Now I'm going to go in to the minus two tube and take 100 microliters in there and that will be transferred into minus three tube. Now discard it again and pay the fresh tip and not open the minus three and that is how I'm going to do until the crystal violet is diluted tenfold across the tubes. So all you're doing is just gradually diluting your initial stock sample reducing the numbers with the amount by a tenfold Just remember to keep changing the tip as you dilute.\n\n","    Janet Nale 9:58\n\n","    That is the minor six We are graduating to minus seven MCs. Good to take that. And now we have added to the minus eight, you may choose to eliminate 100 microliters from the minus minus eight to ensure you've got equal amount. But for this case, this is unnecessary. So I'm just showing you the graduation of the color of the crystal violet within the tube. And as you can see, by the time we get to minus eight, it is basically\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 10:42\n\n","    reduced\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:44\n\n","    drastically to a clear liquid. So for us to actually see this in a visual way, I've now put 96 well plate culture played out. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters of the diluted crystal violet into the well. So I'm just changing the volume setting till I get 200 microliters. So this is p 200 p pet. So it's set. So to 200. So these are my tips, the p p 200. Tips, which will match my P 200. Micro micro pipette. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters to each of the wells. So I'm going to press again the plunger to the first stop. So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n"],"children":["cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","8dd96423-b5ca-4433-bb14-c635df7e0704"],"content":[{"id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"e6b5c475-067b-4ebd-8362-5c8a0a07b510","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:06\n\n","    Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

So all you're doing is just gradually diluting your initial stock sample reducing the numbers with the amount by a tenfold Just remember to keep changing the tip as you dilute.\n\n","    Janet Nale 9:58\n\n","    That is the minor six We are graduating to minus seven MCs. Good to take that. And now we have added to the minus eight, you may choose to eliminate 100 microliters from the minus minus eight to ensure you've got equal amount. But for this case, this is unnecessary. So I'm just showing you the graduation of the color of the crystal violet within the tube. And as you can see, by the time we get to minus eight, it is basically\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 10:42\n\n","    reduced\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:44\n\n","    drastically to a clear liquid. So for us to actually see this in a visual way, I've now put 96 well plate culture played out. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters of the diluted crystal violet into the well. So I'm just changing the volume setting till I get 200 microliters. So this is p 200 p pet. So it's set. So to 200. So these are my tips, the p p 200. Tips, which will match my P 200. Micro micro pipette. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters to each of the wells. So I'm going to press again the plunger to the first stop. So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","2c9f9bce-f342-4c2b-8bfc-7a8fafce4544","5c128188-4fab-4349-b761-089a6b8b314a","3ef5090e-9b62-4960-b40e-7d6b1d099a08","ff484326-0c5c-40cf-987d-80a912a7adaf","6ec64614-6d86-4e3e-8f1b-a653ccdfdb63","49eb0cbf-f40c-4062-ba65-fc4cd25d6d0c","895dc0e1-09ac-464d-81ac-6cc34dcf0817","9a52503d-ed10-4ee8-b18e-ff13a094924b","5f1704f0-df56-414d-b786-8a2b6dd1ad4e","3791ee6e-06ee-4311-b371-ab7bb8ece87f","1f971023-b531-41f3-8a9d-bc0e09f84c94","c0f2b33b-f907-4ad9-a9c7-c69aa34accbf","4002a578-0879-4631-bc49-d17fc4f1d4f8","92badb7c-6d05-4919-a75e-0642123a16f9","7cc5d10b-c74e-4e41-b6c8-3d7e875dad12","5bd83d34-7771-4041-b8e9-1d51ed98f488"],"content":[{"id":"24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 0:06","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 0:06"]]},"parent_id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 0:06\n\n"]},{"id":"852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","type":"text","value":"Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

In this video, we are going to apply our knowledge on serial dilution to be able to enumerate a phage. So if you haven't seen my previous video on how I use crystal violet, diluting it to decreasing concentration, please, I will really recommend that you have a look at that video because that will greatly help in the understanding of the serial dilution that we are going to conduct now on the phage. So I'm going to dilute this page because I need to enumerate the number of phage, or the concentration of phage within this feature lysate that I have got. So I have got a universal truth here containing some phage. So now I'm going to I have already added SM buffer into the tube. And because I'm going to do my dilution in one meal that is 1000 microliters, I have added 900 microliters of the SM buffer into each of the tubes shown in the video. So I've labeled that minus one to minus eight. And I've picked my P 1000 micropipette. And I've set it to 100 microliters. And now I'm going to use my P 200. Tips, which will fit my P 100. micropipette. I'm going to take one of each and transfer 100 microliters. So if you refer back to my video, the crystal violet, I have to use the same method to dilute the crystal violet. And this is a 10 fold serial dilution. So 100 microliters of the phage lysate is going to be transferred to my first tube containing my 900 microliters of the diamond which is SM buffer and I'm mixing it by pipetting up and down just a couple of times using the plunger. I'm going to throw that tip away. And I'm going to take a fresh tip you have to change the tip because you're moving for from a higher concentration to a lower concentration or in your diner. And so I've just aspirated 100 microliters of the minus one diluted sample, and I've added it to the minus two tube, mix it throw away the tape, I'm not taking a fresh tip, and going in to the minus two tube aspirating 100 microliters and then adding that to the minus three tube. And I'm just mixed it might be putting up and down, threw away that pipette tip and then taking the minus three removing hundred microliters into minus four. So this is just diluting my phage from a very high concentration to low concentration in a systematic way using 10 fold dilution methods. And it is reducing my phage to a certain amount that I will be able to count. Now I'm adding from the minus five to minus six. throwing away the pet got fresh pet back to minus six. Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight. So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections.

So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections.

Because it is very important to understand what I did in that previous video for you to be able to understand and interpret the result we are going to see here. So just to recap, in that previous video, all I did was to conduct 10 for serial dilution of a phage in SM buffer, and then supported 10 microliters. of the serially diluted phage on a lawn of a bacterium, I cultured the whole setup in 37 degrees centigrade overnight. And now I'm going to check the plates. So this is the plate. And if you remember the plate, I divided it into eight different sections. And as you can see, you can see Clarence on the lawn, so around the area where I did not sport, you would see cloudiness. And this just shows the bacteria has grown. So this is the first thing you want to look for. Because if you don't have a good loan, you will not have a good spot test because there will be no bacteria for your phage to infect so you can see the zone of clearance. And you can see complete clearance from the minus one because you have more fish there are reduced clearance or plaques across till you got to the minus six. So this is a type of results you are expecting to see if you conduct your serial dilution correctly.

subtitles Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory. In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.<br>So the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.<br>We have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.<br>phages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.<br>Here's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.<br>We accomplish this mission in two general programs. The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.<br>So these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.<br>From their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.<br>Our first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process. And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019. And we actually had participants from six different countries in West Africa that was hosted in Ghana. And then most recently, in January 2020. We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.<br>Let me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform. We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops. In the most recent East Africa workshop. They came from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, they represented 14 different institutions. And they came from all different levels within their careers, graduate students, technicians, research assistants, lecturers, professors, professors and government scientists. And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.<br>funders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible. So we're very grateful for this community involvement.<br>At this workshop, we had our three original instructors, Professor Martha cloaky, from the University of Leicester, in the UK, and Dr. Janet nali. Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching. This time we had Slav, mich new ski from the University of Warwick in the UK.<br>And the goals of each workshop are not only to learn phage biology and experimental techniques, but also this is really important to develop a network of phage researchers starting in the given region, East Africa or say Southeast Asia, and then helping to connect them to other researchers throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US are America and<br>the topics covered include phage, ecology, molecular biology, various models for studying how phages interact with their bacteria phage applications in agriculture, including both animals and crops, phage therapy, compassionate use cases as well as clinical trials. And then each of the instructors talks about their current area of phage research to give some very practical examples of how phages might be applied. We also try to help the participants of the workshop prepare to get funding for their phage product projects, and also how to engage with the public that might be with a few<br>consumers of their phage product, the regulatory authorities, whoever it may be,<br>to get the support, they'll need to get phages utilized in their country. And then we're constantly compiling collection of key scientific publications. And we discussed that many of those during the workshops.<br>So just to give you an idea, at the end of the first two week workshop, as I said, which was hosted in Uganda in 2017, we were able to successfully isolate some phages, we being the participants of the workshop with support from the instructors. And so here are some transmission electron microscope images, microscopic images of some of the phages that were isolated. We've named these all up for Uganda phage, to a through five B. These were originally isolated from a sewage plant outside Kampala, Uganda, pure originally purified in Uganda and then further characterized back in the UK. And all of these have been made available to the participants of the workshop. So it's exciting to see that within just two weeks, phages can begin to be isolated by these workshop participants.<br>I mentioned that the network develop and the development and the relationships is a really important part of this. And I'm highlighting this spend a few hours together in a sewage plant, and it's a very bonding experience. You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.<br>So let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.<br>Starting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.<br>Then after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And<br>then, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants. So they were either starting new projects or significantly modifying projects that they'd previously initiated, because they'd learned some key things from attending our workshop. There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.<br>Even more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.<br>And at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first<br>from all of the<br>workshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's<br>Just within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.<br>So now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.<br>Our intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries. And it's akin to this saying from Lao Tzu and Martha cookie first made this slide. If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. And so as Martha rewarded this, if you give a woman or man a phage, you may treat one infection. Teach a woman or man how to isolate phages and you may treat multiple infections caused by many different pathogens. And that's our goal and hope here.

In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.<br>So the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.<br>We have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.<br>phages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.<br>Here's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.<br>We accomplish this mission in two general programs. The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.<br>So these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.<br>From their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.<br>Our first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process. And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019. And we actually had participants from six different countries in West Africa that was hosted in Ghana. And then most recently, in January 2020. We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.<br>Let me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform. We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops. In the most recent East Africa workshop. They came from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, they represented 14 different institutions. And they came from all different levels within their careers, graduate students, technicians, research assistants, lecturers, professors, professors and government scientists. And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.<br>funders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible. So we're very grateful for this community involvement.<br>At this workshop, we had our three original instructors, Professor Martha cloaky, from the University of Leicester, in the UK, and Dr. Janet nali. Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching. This time we had Slav, mich new ski from the University of Warwick in the UK.<br>And the goals of each workshop are not only to learn phage biology and experimental techniques, but also this is really important to develop a network of phage researchers starting in the given region, East Africa or say Southeast Asia, and then helping to connect them to other researchers throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US are America and<br>the topics covered include phage, ecology, molecular biology, various models for studying how phages interact with their bacteria phage applications in agriculture, including both animals and crops, phage therapy, compassionate use cases as well as clinical trials. And then each of the instructors talks about their current area of phage research to give some very practical examples of how phages might be applied. We also try to help the participants of the workshop prepare to get funding for their phage product projects, and also how to engage with the public that might be with a few<br>consumers of their phage product, the regulatory authorities, whoever it may be,<br>to get the support, they'll need to get phages utilized in their country. And then we're constantly compiling collection of key scientific publications. And we discussed that many of those during the workshops.<br>So just to give you an idea, at the end of the first two week workshop, as I said, which was hosted in Uganda in 2017, we were able to successfully isolate some phages, we being the participants of the workshop with support from the instructors. And so here are some transmission electron microscope images, microscopic images of some of the phages that were isolated. We've named these all up for Uganda phage, to a through five B. These were originally isolated from a sewage plant outside Kampala, Uganda, pure originally purified in Uganda and then further characterized back in the UK. And all of these have been made available to the participants of the workshop. So it's exciting to see that within just two weeks, phages can begin to be isolated by these workshop participants.<br>I mentioned that the network develop and the development and the relationships is a really important part of this. And I'm highlighting this spend a few hours together in a sewage plant, and it's a very bonding experience. You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.<br>So let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.<br>Starting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.<br>Then after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And<br>then, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants. So they were either starting new projects or significantly modifying projects that they'd previously initiated, because they'd learned some key things from attending our workshop. There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.<br>Even more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.<br>And at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first<br>from all of the<br>workshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's<br>Just within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.<br>So now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.<br>Our intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries.

The first are laboratory training workshops. These are hands on two week regional training programs in Africa and Asia. And then we also have some ongoing product development projects where we partner with infectious disease specialists in Africa. And eventually we hope to do so in Asia to co develop phage products. And so, this new endeavor phages for global health online is really our attempt to put these laboratory training workshops online, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when we cannot at the moment deliver in person trainings.\nSo these workshops are, as I mentioned, two weeks hands on laboratory trainings, through which the participants learn how to isolate and characterize faces.\nFrom their local sources, we bring scientists from across a given region. So East Africa, West Africa, Southeast Asia. And we coordinate all of the lab supplies, flights, hotels, meals for all of the participants, and the workshop instructors.\nOur first workshop was held in East Africa in 2017, as shown here in Uganda. The second workshop was hosted in Kenya in 2018. And for each of these people came for selected by through a competitive application process. And they came from four different countries throughout East Africa. And then we went to West Africa for the first time in 2019. And we actually had participants from six different countries in West Africa that was hosted in Ghana. And then most recently, in January 2020. We went back and had our third workshop in East Africa hosted in Tanzania just before our as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. So we've had four workshops thus far we were planning to hold our first workshop in Southeast Asia hosted in Malaysia in November, but we had to postpone that during due to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be delivering that workshop as soon as conditions allow.\nLet me give you a flavor of what those workshops were since that's or trying to reinvent that, if you will, through this online platform. We had, as I mentioned, there were the participants were selected through a competitive application process. We had a total of 25 participants in most of these workshops. In the most recent East Africa workshop. They came from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, they represented 14 different institutions. And they came from all different levels within their careers, graduate students, technicians, research assistants, lecturers, professors, professors and government scientists. And our intention is really to include people from all different levels and backgrounds because we believe it will take people in various positions to help bring phage technology forward in Africa and Asia will need people who are working in the lab daily developing phage products, but and will also need people who are in position to make decisions about how resources will be utilized in their institutions and in their countries.\nfunders for this most recent workshop came from the conservation Food and Health Foundation, the microbiology society in the company of biologists, both in the UK and through crowdfunding. About 60 different people donated to help us make this workshop possible. So we're very grateful for this community involvement.\nAt this workshop, we had our three original instructors, Professor Martha cloaky, from the University of Leicester, in the UK, and Dr. Janet nali. Also from the University of Leicester, Benjamin Chan from Yale University. In fact, this idea of starting these workshops really initiated from a conversation that Ben and I had together where he suggested this. I do a little bit of the teaching and then in this most recent workshop, Dr. Shawna McKellen from Switzerland was able to join us as one of our instructors was, which was a great addition. At each workshop, we've been able to bring at least one teaching assistant to help with a lot of the hands on preparation for each bit of lab work and to help with some of the teaching. This time we had Slav, mich new ski from the University of Warwick in the UK.\nAnd the goals of each workshop are not only to learn phage biology and experimental techniques, but also this is really important to develop a network of phage researchers starting in the given region, East Africa or say Southeast Asia, and then helping to connect them to other researchers throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US are America and\nthe topics covered include phage, ecology, molecular biology, various models for studying how phages interact with their bacteria phage applications in agriculture, including both animals and crops, phage therapy, compassionate use cases as well as clinical trials. And then each of the instructors talks about their current area of phage research to give some very practical examples of how phages might be applied. We also try to help the participants of the workshop prepare to get funding for their phage product projects, and also how to engage with the public that might be with a few\nconsumers of their phage product, the regulatory authorities, whoever it may be,\nto get the support, they'll need to get phages utilized in their country. And then we're constantly compiling collection of key scientific publications. And we discussed that many of those during the workshops.\nSo just to give you an idea, at the end of the first two week workshop, as I said, which was hosted in Uganda in 2017, we were able to successfully isolate some phages, we being the participants of the workshop with support from the instructors. And so here are some transmission electron microscope images, microscopic images of some of the phages that were isolated. We've named these all up for Uganda phage, to a through five B. These were originally isolated from a sewage plant outside Kampala, Uganda, pure originally purified in Uganda and then further characterized back in the UK. And all of these have been made available to the participants of the workshop. So it's exciting to see that within just two weeks, phages can begin to be isolated by these workshop participants.\nI mentioned that the network develop and the development and the relationships is a really important part of this. And I'm highlighting this spend a few hours together in a sewage plant, and it's a very bonding experience. You'll see smiles on lots of people's faces in this photo, and many of these researchers have continued to work together even though they're in different countries to collaborate on some of their projects.\nSo let me talk about some of the outcomes we've seen thus far from these workshops in 2017 through 2020.\nStarting three months after each workshop, we survey the participants to find out how many new phage research projects they've initiated. So five were initiated within three months after the Uganda workshop, how many institutions were there now teaching phage biology. So for again, after that workshop, and how many grant proposals they've submitted in this case, not only did they submit two grant proposals, but one of those was a large proposal that involved researchers from multiple countries working together, which was exciting to see.\nThen after the 2018 workshop, we saw 16 new feech research projects started within three months, they were teaching at eight institutions and had submitted for grant proposals. And part of the reason we think we saw this acceleration in the outcomes was that some of the people who attended our 2018 workshop in Kenya, had learned about phage therapy from participants of the 2017 workshop and Uganda. And so they were sort of primed and ready to get going on some of their work. And\nthen, as I mentioned, we went to West Africa for the first time. And because of funding restrictions, we actually included only 18 participants in this workshop, and yet they were very active, really on par with their East African compatriots, initiated 11 new projects, teaching at eight institutions and submitting a whopping eight grant proposals. And then, earlier this year, we started to see that some of the workshop participants might have already started a little bit of phage research before they got to us because they'd learned from some of the previous workshop participants. So they were either starting new projects or significantly modifying projects that they'd previously initiated, because they'd learned some key things from attending our workshop. There, they were now teaching at 13 different institutions across East East Africa. And they had submitted even more 12 grants proposals. So we're very excited to see that this can quickly take off and even scale as people share their knowledge with others in their region.\nEven more exciting, it's been now three years since the first workshop.\nAnd at the time that we took this data, a survey from the participants of the first\nfrom all of the\nworkshops that had occurred at that time, they had started a total of 50 new phage research projects. This is including all of the workshop participants. They taught phage biology to add a total of 1100 African scientists through their home institutions, and they'd won grants totaling to over $925,000 so it's\nJust within three years, we're very excited and very encouraged by how quickly this is taking off.\nSo now with that is a background of that's how we did our in person training programs. Now we're launching phages for global health online, in this era of the coronavirus pandemic, when many things are becoming virtual instead of in person. And as I said, we've developed this in partnership with Phage Directory, we've won a grant together from the Mozilla Foundation to do this. And we're launching this in December 2020.\nOur intention is to make these resources available free to anyone in the world. And over time, we will continue to add features to this. So we hope you enjoy this and find this useful, and we welcome any suggestions or feedback people may have. And I'll just end by highlighting what what we're trying to do is enable scientists in Africa and Asia to develop products that can be used to address the antibiotic resistance crisis in their own countries. And it's akin to this saying from Lao Tzu and Martha cookie first made this slide. If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. And so as Martha rewarded this, if you give a woman or man a phage, you may treat one infection. Teach a woman or man how to isolate phages and you may treat multiple infections caused by many different pathogens. And that's our goal and hope here. Thanks much."]]},"parent_id":"3120190e-9616-442b-b80c-4bc40e1f6aae","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Auto-generated video subtitles Hi, I'm Toby Nagel, founder and president of phages for global health, and I'm really excited to introduce you to our new platform phages for global health online, which we've developed in partnership with our collaborators at Phage Directory. In this introductory video, I'll tell you how this came about and what you can expect out of the series of resources that we're making available online.<br>So the reason we're doing this work is that antibiotic resistant infections are expected to kill 10 million people each year by 2050. And by comparison, Coronavirus, has killed 1.3 million people within the first 10 and a half months of this pandemic. So the antibiotic resistance crisis is huge. It's this infectious disease tsunami that's coming.<br>We have an urgent need for antibiotic alternatives and bacteria. phages, which are more easily known as phages are one such technology that might serve that purpose. phages are viruses that can kill bacteria, they naturally naturally exist in our bodies food and environment. And they do not harm human cells. But they can kill both antibiotic resistant and sensitive bacteria. And they kill only specific bacteria. So you can think of them as sort of a narrow spectrum antibiotic, as compared with broad spectrum antibiotic, traditional chemical antibiotics that kill a wide variety of bacteria. So given phage might just kill salmonella, or just cholera, but not a whole panel of different types of bacteria.<br>phages were actually used as antibacterial agents in the US, Europe, and Asia, even before antibiotics were discovered and started to be used in the 1940s. They're still being used in the former Soviet Union. And actually, it's been over 100 years since they were first being tested there.<br>Here's an example a photo of some of the phages that you can actually buy over the counter today from the country of Georgia. And because phages have seen such effectiveness in the former Soviet Union, they're now starting to be revisited in the US and Europe. They've been approved for food decontamination. And for emergency clinical cases, actually, I believe in hundreds of patients. Now, there are currently larger, ongoing clinical trials. But they've not yet been used much in Africa or Asia, I think it's fair to say they've not been used in Africa at all and very little in Asia in recent decades. And the reason this matters is that 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistance are expected to occur in Africa and Asia. And that's shown in this data here, which was part of a 2014 publication that came out of the UK led by Jim O'Neill. And what this map shows is the number of deaths that are expected each year in each region, from antibiotic resistance. And so you can see it's a little under 400,000 deaths are expected each year in Europe, North America, Latin America, and even less Down Under. But unfortunately, over 4 million deaths are expected each year in Africa even more in Asia. And so as I said, that means that about 90% of the deaths will occur in Africa and Asia. Yet there are very few phage experts in those regions, the majority of those phage experts are actually in North America and Europe. And so simply put the mission of phages for global health is to bring phage expertise to Africa and Asia.<br>We accomplish this mission in two general programs.

<summary>Auto-generated Subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 0:00\n\n","    Hi, everyone. I am Dr. Shawna MacAllan. And I am a phage and clinical researcher here at the bogus University Hospital in Zurich. And I'm happy to be one of the lecturers in this online course series for phages. And today we're going to be talking about my favorite topic, which are clinical trials for phage therapy. And to start off with, I'd like to ask you a question. And that is, why would you take this medicine? So here you can see it's a bottle of aspirin, it's probably something that we've all come across and needed in our lifetimes and anti inflammatory and it's commonplace everywhere, across the world. So if you've answered yes to this question, I want to ask you, would you take this medicine, this is the Pio bacteriophage cocktail produced by elliana in Tbilisi, Georgia. So it is a registered medicine or product in Georgia, and it's sold as an over the counter medicine in the pharmacy. And when you look at these two different products, start to think about what makes you say, Okay, I'll take a pill of aspirin, and maybe might make you hesitate before you would take Pio bacteria phages. And that's really what we want to go through today is to look at why we do clinical trials, because this is what we need in order to bring a product to market.\n\n","    And in order to understand why we do them,\n\n","    we're going to have to briefly look at how they came about through history and where this idea of performing experiments on humans, rather than a test tube or on animals came about.\n\n","    Then we'll move on to when we do a\n\n","    clinical trial, what are the main different parts of a clinical study, before we actually move into the modern trials for phage therapy that have been performed to date. And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics. And in order to understand why we do clinical trials, it's really useful that we look at how drug development occurs. So a lot of what we think about for phage therapy phage experiments is really more this discovery phase where we have a great idea or a problem that needs solving. And we look at this problem or interesting idea through basic research, to in vitro tests in vivo tests. And we usually do this at the university or institutional level. But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.\n\n","    And this is just to highlight that each Regulatory Authority across the world can have their sort of particular rules and regulations. And depending on where you want to use that drug, you should can take into consideration what the local regulatory authorities are. And Tanzania, which is where we did our last in person lecture series was really impressive, because Tanzania is the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning and regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the w h o. And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market. So they control the access in of drugs into the market. But they also make sure that the drugs that are there are still functioning and safe. And they're still post surveillance studies that are performed even once a drug has a regulatory authorization. And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant. There is another few issues actually that have to do with introducing bias into the way that they structured this investigation is that there was no randomization. So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time. And lastly, but not all. One of the other issues is that this investigation was not blinded. So normally with a clinical trial, we really try not to know, either from the perspective of the patient, or if the treating physician what your patient is actually receiving if they're getting a placebo or the standard of care, or if they're getting the investigational product.\n\n","    And this is ultimately because we have a tendency to introduce biases, maybe you could treat a patient better than another or some way differently if you knew what you were giving them within the clinical trial. And this could really bias your results. Now, where clinical trials really developed was out of, you know, the devastation of World War Two. So this was, unfortunately, during this time, with the Nazi occupation, Nazi concentration camps, there was extreme inhumane experimentation performed on humans. And this really led to the development of ethical codes for how we have to work with patients, ethically, to ensure their dignity, and their well being and their freedom of choice. So this led to a variety of different legislations that have been adopted in various forums across the world, notably the Nuremberg Code, and the Helsinki declaration, that has really improved the way that we treat patients that are part of clinical trials. And overall, what this has led to is that when you perform a clinical trial, not only do you have to have the ethical committee or the regulatory authorities involved, you also to have to have an ethical Committee, which will look at the structure of your study, and possibly do some monitoring of the study to ensure that the patients are treated the way that they should be. And they're, they're ethically treated. And this also means that when we involve any type of human subjects in clinical research, where we make sure that we get informed consent, so that they are aware of what the study is, what they could happen to them, and that they have the right to withdrawal from the study at any point in time, for any reason. And there's also the idea that now patients as well, we have to go to great lengths to anonymize their data and protect their privacy.\n\n","    So really,\n\n","    as time goes on, we see a progression of clinical trials and how we did them. And one of the first randomized clinical trials, or the first actually comes from 1948. And in line with phage therapy, this also also has to do with bacterial infections. And so the first randomized clinical trial was actually investigating the use of structure myosin, to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and this was published in the British Medical Journal. And it was really, really remarkable because through this trial, they were able to show that when you treated with that strep demise, and only 7% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis die, whereas without step two minds and almost one third or 20% of the control patients, they they passed away. So again, that idea of introducing randomization is a way to reduce bias in your clinical trial and to have a greater trust in the data that you produce. So this concludes the first section and I will pick back up with you shortly where we look into the next sections of clinical trials for phage therapy.

And so the first randomized clinical trial was actually investigating the use of structure myosin, to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and this was published in the British Medical Journal. And it was really, really remarkable because through this trial, they were able to show that when you treated with that strep demise, and only 7% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis die, whereas without step two minds and almost one third or 20% of the control patients, they they passed away. So again, that idea of introducing randomization is a way to reduce bias in your clinical trial and to have a greater trust in the data that you produce. So this concludes the first section and I will pick back up with you shortly where we look into the next sections of clinical trials for phage therapy.

And lastly, to end this lecture, I'd like to talk about some perspectives for the future of clinical trials for phage therapy. Now, it's kind of a big subject matters. So I've broken it down into several smaller sections. So in this first series, or this first little lecture of this part, we're going to talk about the first two topics. And in order to understand why we do clinical trials, it's really useful that we look at how drug development occurs. So a lot of what we think about for phage therapy phage experiments is really more this discovery phase where we have a great idea or a problem that needs solving. And we look at this problem or interesting idea through basic research, to in vitro tests in vivo tests. And we usually do this at the university or institutional level. But what happens when we want to take that idea and then somehow end up treating patients with it is then you move into a drug development phase where you perform clinical trials, these are usually broken down into phases. So we've got Phase One, two, and three. And then this is the they're different, and we'll talk about them a little bit more in detail. But in terms of their purpose, the types of subjects you would include and how many you would need. And then once if all goes well through these clinical trials, that you're showing that your break, great idea that you've done your preclinical research with is both safe and effective, then hopefully you can attain regulatory approval. And this is what's really going to allow you to move an idea into something that can be used to treat patients. So when we're doing a clinical trial, the idea is that we want to answer a question. And we really need to generate solid evidence or data in order to determine if a drug firstly is safe. This is usually what we do through phase one trials. And then also if the drug is effective, if it is doing what we claim that it is able to do. And this is where we start to look at in phase two and phase three clinical trials. And who is actually performing clinical research. Well, usually we have, we have two main people who are involved with a clinical trial. So this is firstly a sponsor, and this is the person who is responsible person or entity even that is responsible for initiating, managing and or financing and clinical trial. So sometimes and often this is a pharmaceutical company that is the sponsor, so they're paying for and designing a clinical trial to test their product in humans. And then the other very important part of this is the investigator. So this is the physician Who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a bit of sponsor or initiator is sort of can be the same entity depending on the type of trial. But you can never have a sponsor that doesn't trial without an investigator. An overall the idea of doing a clinical trial is to obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory authorities. Because this is where you do your trial, and you present it to the regulatory authority showing the drug is safe and effective. And it's up to them to then decide if you are able to sell, distribute, distribute and be reimbursed for the product that you are trying to develop. And regulatory authorities, they change all over the world. So I would say the most well known, particularly for me, because I'm originally American, is the FDA, so the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America, and their counterpart in Europe, which is where I'm located now is the European Medicines Agency, or the AMA, but many countries themselves, including Switzerland, we have our own regulatory agency, this is called Swiss medic. Then there's others such as the TGA. In Australia, or the FDA, for example, the Tanzanian food and drugs authority in Tanzania.","properties":{"title":[["clinical trial, what are the main different parts of a clinical study, before we actually move into the modern trials for phage therapy that have been performed to date.

And so that's really something impressive. And regulatory agencies are super important for protecting patients and making sure that the drugs that we have available to us when we buy them in the pharmacy or we get them in the hospital are a high quality, and we'll do what they say we expect them to. And so what they actually really do the regulatory agency is that they're both the gatekeeper to the market, and then the watch keeper of the market. So they control the access in of drugs into the market. But they also make sure that the drugs that are there are still functioning and safe. And they're still post surveillance studies that are performed even once a drug has a regulatory authorization. And they're responsible responsibilities are majorly to ensure that the medicines are of high quality, and they protect both us patients and society. And the idea of doing research on humans is not a new topic. So the first thing we usually talk about in the history of clinical trials is Patrick Lind, who performed experiments in 1747, so many, many years ago, and this is when he was dealing with the issue of sailors coming down with scurvy. And the first recorded experiment is when he tried to treat sailors to 12 patients, which he divided into six groups with these different types of possible remedies. So you can see on the one side there that one group received elixir of vitriol, another one was made to drink sea water, a third one got spicy paste while somebody else got vinegar or cider. And lastly, the sixth group received two oranges and a lemon, an important source of vitamin C. And while we look back on this, and particularly for the time, it was sort of revolutionary to take humans and then see if we could treat them for a specific condition. And of course, in that experiment, the two oranges and the lemon really led to being able to reduce scurvy and sailors by supplementation with vitamin C and eating appropriate fruits. It still isn't a shining example of what we would want to do for a clinical trial today. So what was missing in this specific I guess we could call it a study was that it was a very small population size. So only 12 patients and already divided into six groups means that you only had two sailors per group. So this is very small, and that the results that they would have found are not significant. There is another few issues actually that have to do with introducing bias into the way that they structured this investigation is that there was no randomization. So normally when we do a clinical trial, patients come in and depending on the trial, we don't know, or we try not to know, or to decide in advance if a patient comes in which treatment they were going to receive. So in this instance, we're not really sure how the decision made was made between which sailors got allocated to which group. Now another issue is that there was no control. So at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. And so they could have or should have had placebo or standard of care on, which would have meant having two groups of or a group of sailors that did not receive treatment, or that received what was currently done for scurvy at the time.

And this could really bias your results. Now, where clinical trials really developed was out of, you know, the devastation of World War Two. So this was, unfortunately, during this time, with the Nazi occupation, Nazi concentration camps, there was extreme inhumane experimentation performed on humans. And this really led to the development of ethical codes for how we have to work with patients, ethically, to ensure their dignity, and their well being and their freedom of choice. So this led to a variety of different legislations that have been adopted in various forums across the world, notably the Nuremberg Code, and the Helsinki declaration, that has really improved the way that we treat patients that are part of clinical trials. And overall, what this has led to is that when you perform a clinical trial, not only do you have to have the ethical committee or the regulatory authorities involved, you also to have to have an ethical Committee, which will look at the structure of your study, and possibly do some monitoring of the study to ensure that the patients are treated the way that they should be.

And we are back for the second segment of this lecture on clinical trials for phage therapy. And we've just gotten done, speaking about the first parts of why we do clinical trials and also about some of the historical events that have really shaped clinical research today. Now, I'd like to move on and show you some of the main parts of a clinical study, because clinical research is quite different than what we're used to doing in a lab per se. So one of the things is that\n\n","    you have\n\n","    to first define your research question. And the idea is you have a research question in order to address a problem or missing piece of information and afield. So, particularly for phage therapy, our problem is really dealing with antibiotic resistance, or treatment failures for infectious disease. And then with the research question, we want to be able to test a possible solution. And in our case, this is bacteria phages. So an example of a research question would be something like can bacteriophages treat urinary tract infections, infections caused by multi drug resistant bacteria. And we'll see that even this is a little bit broad, and you should start with an idea like this, and then make it even more finer. finer is one of those great acronyms we use to try to guide and structure our research question. So find R stands for F meaning feasible, I meaning interesting, and being novel, ie ethical, we saw earlier that that's very important. And our that is relevant. So you can go through after you've come up with a research question to make sure it kind of ticks all of these boxes as of finer. So if we take the title of this\n\n","    publication, and\n\n","    we try to go through and pick out the Pico characteristics of the study, first we have so who is the population the key and key code, then who are we treating in this, this trial is urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. So that's the population that the study was targeting. Then in terms of the intra intervention, it's intra vesicle bacteriophages. Then for the control, it says in the title, it's placebo controlled, you'll have to read the study to find out what placebo was, then for the outcome, then its treatment. So they're really looking at the ability to treat urinary tract infections. And then if we look at the T, the type of study it is a double blind clinical trial. And I would say they could even gone further and indicated the phase of the study in this case, it would have been a phase two clinical trial.\n\n","    And when we look to design\n\n","    a study, first thing is we want to make sure that the trial is randomized, meaning that when a patient comes in, you don't know which of the treatment arms they'd be allocated to. So there's usually a whole system on how to randomize or a randomizing code. So it's not like the first 10 patients get the intervention. And then the next 10 patients get the placebo, or all of your patients starting with the first letter M get the intervention is usually a much more sophisticated and unpredictable system of deciding which patient gets which treatment. Another aspect for clinical trial design is that the study should be blinded, meaning that you should look at who actually knows who's getting what. So we could do a single blinded trial where only the patient doesn't know if what they're getting, you could do a double blinded trial where the physician, both the treating physician and the patient don't know what they're they're getting or administrating. Or depending on the design of the trial, you could also do a triple blinded saying, you know, maybe it's the person who prepares the medicines\n\n","    or\n\n","    something like that, you can either blind the study further. Then another important aspect is the control arm so you can't just you know, treat all of the patients with phages and then say okay, well this many, they their urinary tract infection got better, you have to be able to compare it to something. So in some instances, depending on the clinical indication, you would compare it to the standard of care that might be antibiotics or an answer my question We'll cream and other instances it would be a placebo. And that really depends on how the indication you're looking at is currently treated and what is ethical. And these three factors are these three things to design into the structure of a clinical trial are really important ways to reduce\n\n","    bias.\n\n","    So reduce sort of trying to structure your study in a way that will influence the final outcome. And then lastly, one other important aspect, super important aspect of a clinical trial is your expected effect. So the way that we judge if a clinical trial is a success or a failure is by looking at the primary outcome. So this is really your bottom line, what is the most important criteria that you are using or you're looking at in a clinical trial, and this is usually something when you're looking at advocacy is it's very patient centric, you know, if phages can make the bacteria go down, that's great. But if your patient still isn't feeling better, then ultimately, you wouldn't use phages in order to treat an infection. So usually, you want to have a primary outcome that is really centered around the patient. But then you can also design into the structure of a clinical trial, secondary outcomes. And this is usually where we add in aspects of microbiology, which is important for phages. Okay, an overall goal of a clinical trial is to obtain a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparing. So between, say, phages, and antibiotics or phages, and placebo, and the way that you judge that is through your primary outcome measure, and then P value of that difference. So the magical p value is really the statistical measure, then that will tell you if based off of all the the analysis you've done, if what you're looking at is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely that the outcome you are looking at is due to due to Chancellor. And my screen\n\n","    is pressing again,\n\n","    there we go.\n\n","    So another criteria, and when you're looking at a clinical trial to make sure that whatever it's saying is really sound is that studying the product safe, that there are no major biases that were introduced in the design of the study. So we saw randomization, blinding and comparatives, that the appropriate measures were taken, and super important for clinical trials are is that you used enough patience, that the intervention and the control were tested on enough people. So we'll see in a little bit that many of the clinical trials today for phage therapy involve a very few amount of patients. And when you don't have enough patients, it's difficult to know if what you're seeing is just due to chance, or if it's really something significant. And now the outcome is of a trial really affect what happens next. So if you can have a phase of a trial, say a phase one trial, and it shouldn't be safe, and then you would be allowed to progress into phase two studies. Or Also, if you're already in phase two, looking at efficacy, if you've met your primary outcomes, and the trial was success, you would be allowed to move into phase three. And then eventually, if you complete your phase three trials, and everything was starting to go well, you may at that stage be able to gain regulatory approval and marketing authorizations. And also this can really lead to a change in current practice.\n\n","    And if we look specifically at anti microbial development today, it's a major problem. I'm assuming if you're interested in phages, and phage therapy, then you're aware of this. But when we look back, even 3030 or 40 years ago, we would have a certain number of new antibacterial agents that were approved every year. So we're thinking, you know, back in the early 1980s, or 1980s, were up to 16 new drugs per year still being developed and approved for treating bacterial infections. Whereas now, you look down to the most recent data in this graph from 2008 to 2012. And that's maybe one or two. So that coupled with increasing costs for developing new medicines. Now they estimate that almost 400 and 60 million US dollars are required to go from, you know, when you have that bright idea to getting your authorizations, it's almost 500 million US dollars. And that is just an insane amount of money, especially when we're talking about infectious disease. You couple all of this, with the fact that time is really running out on the utility, we have antibiotics, and new alternatives are desperately needed. So if we look at how this relates a little bit to phage therapy, we've gone through the different studies. So we haven't talked before about phase zero. This is an observational study, which I would highly recommend, especially for phage based trials, because that's where you really look at your baseline demographics of a patient population. So in the incidence of urinary tract infections, for example, you would look to see which pathogens are causing the infection, look at the different strains and maybe their sensitivity to phages. Now, the phases one through four are really when you're in patience, and then this goes up in the probably the cost, but also the amount of patience, and then the different goals that you have for each of the phases. And really, the golden would you say the golden ticket is to get a successful phase three trial where you can obtain a marketing authorization. And now there's been a number shown here in these these small orange arrows of phase one safety studies that have been done with phage products. So if you look through the literature, there's quite a few of phase one trials and to date, there's been no phase one studies that have associated phage products with any type of safety concern. And then there's a few trials that now you can see in the slightly bolder orange arrows that are completed phase two trials. So this is really where they're looking for early signs of efficacy. And now that's what we're going to talk about in the next section after this short break is looking at the for phase two click clinical trials for phage therapy that have been completed today. Alright, see you in a little bit.

Whereas now, you look down to the most recent data in this graph from 2008 to 2012. And that's maybe one or two. So that coupled with increasing costs for developing new medicines. Now they estimate that almost 400 and 60 million US dollars are required to go from, you know, when you have that bright idea to getting your authorizations, it's almost 500 million US dollars. And that is just an insane amount of money, especially when we're talking about infectious disease. You couple all of this, with the fact that time is really running out on the utility, we have antibiotics, and new alternatives are desperately needed. So if we look at how this relates a little bit to phage therapy, we've gone through the different studies. So we haven't talked before about phase zero. This is an observational study, which I would highly recommend, especially for phage based trials, because that's where you really look at your baseline demographics of a patient population. So in the incidence of urinary tract infections, for example, you would look to see which pathogens are causing the infection, look at the different strains and maybe their sensitivity to phages. Now, the phases one through four are really when you're in patience, and then this goes up in the probably the cost, but also the amount of patience, and then the different goals that you have for each of the phases. And really, the golden would you say the golden ticket is to get a successful phase three trial where you can obtain a marketing authorization. And now there's been a number shown here in these these small orange arrows of phase one safety studies that have been done with phage products. So if you look through the literature, there's quite a few of phase one trials and to date, there's been no phase one studies that have associated phage products with any type of safety concern. And then there's a few trials that now you can see in the slightly bolder orange arrows that are completed phase two trials. So this is really where they're looking for early signs of efficacy. And now that's what we're going to talk about in the next section after this short break is looking at the for phase two click clinical trials for phage therapy that have been completed today. Alright, see you in a little bit.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures.

Again, this is the final part and for the lecture for clinical trials for phage therapy. So I hope you've enjoyed the first two sections. And this final part really focuses more on diving into the details of the modern trials for phage therapy, and what perspectives we have from these for the future.\n\n","    If we go back to this sort of schema, we saw earlier with the different phases of clinical trials, and then where phage trials fall on to this, we saw that the most important thing in order for drug development is to complete successfully a phase three trial and obtain a marketing authorization from regulatory agencies after that. And where we are with phages is that there have been a number of small phase one studies done in different clinical indications. And only three, that three out here, but there's actually a more recent one, for phase two trials, looking at early signs for efficacy of phage trials.\n\n","    And there's actually one ongoing trial right now. So there's only one phase two trial that's open for enrollment. And we'll touch briefly on that, as well.\n\n","    So let's go through each of the trials one by one. So phase two being the most important for randomized clinical trials, because it's the closest thing that we have on the drug development pathway for phages in order to obtain this, any type of marketing authorization, so the first trial was actually published in 2009. So this is already just over 10 years ago. And this was looking at the use of phages to treat chronic otitis that was caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. And the way they designed that trial is they were using phage therapy, it was a six page cocktail,\n\n","    a single dose directly into the ear. So this would be considered topical administration. And they compare this to placebo, because these were all patients that have been treated chronically and had multiple recurrences. And they had a total of 24 patients in this phase two trial.\n\n","    And next in terms of publications that came out, there was the 2016 publication by sarker. And all this was looking at the use of E. coli phages for the treatment of acute equiline pediatric diarrhea in a pediatric population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this is really targeting e coli. And it was comparing two different phage products. So either a T for like phage cocktail, developed at Nestle here in Switzerland, or a commercial phage cocktail from the Russian company microgen compared to placebo. Now, in the case of this clinical indication, placebo was considered ethical, because there is no active treatment that deals with the microbiological components of pediatric diarrhea. So these phases were applied three times per day orally for a total of four days, and it involved a total of 115 children.\n\n","    Then falling shortly after that was the publication of the faco burns study. This was the first multi site European trial that used GMP manufacturing, or manufactured phages in their trial, and this was really looking at burned wound infections, which are just an awful thing to deal with. So they were looking at using phages to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa compared to the standard of care, which was an anti microbial cream. And this was applied topically for seven days, and they had a total of 25 patients.\n\n","    And then more recently, just very recently, actually, a few months ago, was the trial that we talked about a little in the previous section, looking at phages for the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. And in this trial, they were targeting multiple pathogens, they were able to do so because they were using a commercial phage product from aljada, produced in Tbilisi, Georgia. And so this is a complex cocktail that targets at least six different bacterial species. And they compare this phage products, either to placebo, which was just an empty bacteriophage solution or a standard of care out of it.\n\n","    So either the phage therapy arm or the placebo, we're given intro. Basically, this is what IBS stands for. And the standard of care antibiotics were given either orally or intravenously. So they did these treatments for seven days, and they enrolled a total of 97 patients. So here we have four different trials using four different products, and four different indications and four different locations. It's a lot of differences, but we tend to analyze them all together to have an idea of how phage therapy is working. So let's look at now the outcome of those trials. So if we look at the chronic hepatitis trial, let's see, there we go, it was considered to be a successful trial. So they reach their primary endpoint in showed that phage administration provided a benefit to the phage recipients compared to the patients that were seeking placebo. And this was in terms of patient improvement scores as well as microbial reduction. So already, that sounds promising. But unfortunately, the next trial and the next trial, they were both considered to be failures, because they did not meet their primary endpoints. Now, there are reasons for each of these trials being failures. But ultimately, that's what they are. And we have to accept that result and try to understand it, and make sure that the next studies really learn from those lessons. And we'll go into those details shortly. And then the more recent trial, I would also say it was deemed a failure. And this was because they showed that phage therapy was non inferior to antibiotics, but not superior to placebo. So this is a good time to mention that the way that we talk about product comparisons is either superiority over to saying that phages is better or worse than the standard of care or the placebo, or non inferior to, which means it's not worse then. So we've got those two measures either superiority or non inferiority. So now let's go into each of these details. Now, just move this picture out of the way so you can see a little bit more. So this is the publication if you're interested in looking that up. So this was a randomized clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistance for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and preliminary report of efficacy. So this was done by right and all in 2009. So the way that they set up the trial was that they were targeting if we\n\n","    go through and our use our Pico strategy to try to understand each of these trials. So the patients that were they were looking at the key the population was looking at patients with chronic infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.\n\n","    And then this was the product, the intervention that they were doing in the eyes of Pico. So this was a six phage, and five Pseudomonas originals, the cocktail. And it was given as a single topical dose of six times 10 to the first platform and units for pf use.\n\n","    The control was a placebo.\n\n","    And then their outcome measures were looking at clinical improvements. So a change from their baseline characteristics, as well as secondary current characteristics dealing with the microbiology, so the bacterial and phage counts. And if we look into the results, what you can see here is a graph showing the mean scores. So the vast scores is an idea of the severity of the ear infection. And you can see here that the solid squares are the phage recipients, whereas the open squares are the placebo recipients, and this was the mean value. So the lower the score, the better. So it's a severity score. And you can see then that the mean duration of bacteriophage replication corresponded to a lower vasse score for the combined patient, patient and physician reported scores. So this was really their primary outcome. And then what they looked at as well here as another figure, they looked at the mean Pseudomonas count for the different days as a percentage of the initial count. So either were they increasing, meaning that the counts could be greater than zero or decreasing? greater than 100 excuse me, or less than 100 compared to their baseline? So again, you've got the open squares are the placebo recipients and the closed squares are the test recipients.\n\n","    And you can see clearly in that graph that the patients receiving phages had a lower amount of Pseudomonas in the years.\n\n","    And last year, you can just see a picture, I mean, I am not a physician, so I can really tell you what looks to be like a healthy year. But this one, the top panel is showing a lot of inflammation and redness, whereas the lower panel is showing a more healthy year.\n\n","    So this was deemed a success.\n\n","    And seemed to be good. But I mean, for me, and the perspective of what I would like to see, in terms of age trials, I do think the population was still a little small. So the total amount was 24 patients. And\n\n","    the phase two study was actually stopped early, because they thought the results were so promising. But ultimately, they never continued with the phase three study, it was sort of the company that did the study got taken over by another company, and they didn't think that creating a product for all Titus would have had a sort of financial benefit, or wouldn't have been a financially sound investment. And that is unfortunately, something we really need to take into consideration when you are trying to develop a medicine is that if it's going to be financially viable.\n\n","    So now,\n\n","    that's what we were just talking about. So stopped early for advocacy, no continuation. And one other last final comment about this study is the use sort of mean counts. So the mean counts of all the patients in each of the groups. Whereas if you really pull out the data, you could see that some patients were responding pretty well to this page product. And it did have an actual effect, whereas other patients really didn't have that much of a clinical benefit. And you would almost say it's more on a personalized level, even despite the fact that they looked at phage sensitivity testing as an inclusion criteria.\n\n","    Now, if we move on to the next study that was published after that, in 2016, this was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to fully phage preparations a randomized trial and children from Bangladesh. This was a study and several studies that I was involved with myself when I was working at Nestle. And\n\n","    this is the setup of the trial. So again, we want to look out and pull out this information of the Pico criteria. So starting with the population, this word, these were children with confirmed equalized diarrhea within a certain timeframe. So within 24 hours of symptom onset, the interventions that they were testing were either the tea for phage cocktail, or a microgen commercial cocktail from Russia that was geared against equal lie and produce species, then they tested that against placebo.\n\n","    And when we looked at what we were using to judge the trial off of the primary endpoint was mostly safety. And this was a combined Phase One Two trial. So again, the most important is that you would develop a phage product that is safe. So this was deemed to be very safe. And then secondary was looking at bacteria and phage counts in the stool, as well as the susceptibility of the isolates that were taken from the school and pathogen clearance. Then lastly, as well, they looked at quantitative diarrheal parameters of frequency, volume and severity. And the interesting thing of this is this is so far still the largest\n\n","    phase two clinical trial that's been done for phage therapy, and they had a total of 115 participants.\n\n","    And if we look at the results themselves, this is showing the school parameters. Looking if you look on the x axis, this is showing the different days when the children were involved in the trial. And then on the y axis, you have the amount of school and the colors, the blue corresponds to placebo. The red is the microgen cocktail. And then the green is the tea for like phage cocktail. And you can see here that there's some variability with the days but between the three treatment products, there's no real visible or statistically significant trend in the amount of school so the amount of diarrhea that these children were experiencing.\n\n","    Then when we look at the phage counts, so here on the x axis, you have the different treatment arms, p being placebo and being micro gin, the micro gin cocktail or tea being the tea for product and then on the y axis you have the platform and units per gram of school. What is interesting here in\n\n","    Something to always take into consideration is that if you look at the blue, even though the average count is quite low, there were some of the patients that were enrolled that had phage equal fH in their store, even though they weren't getting it as part of the clinical trial.\n\n","    And then lastly, this is an important graph and interpreting how or why we're trying to make sense of the clinical trial. So this is looking at\n\n","    a high level of the microbiome over the different days. So here, an H, these are healthy controls, and you look at the distribution, or the relative abundance of the different bacteria in the stool. So blue is bifidobacterium. Red is streptococcus well as green as others, and yellow is equiline. So when we were looking at patients on day one, it's true that they did have a slightly greater relative abundance of equal line. But the amount of equal lie between healthy controls and\n\n","    patients with acute diarrhea was only about a one log difference. But what you really see is a trend over time. So here on the x axis, you've got day 1234, and five, and then eventually, day 21, which is follow up, you can see that there's a distribution were starting with a disease state day one, when it was the most severe, you had a low amount of bifidobacterium, and a greater amount of streptococcus. And as the disease sort of resolved over time, you see this distribution change again, where you have a greater amount of bifidobacterium, and a lower amount of streptococcus.\n\n","    So with those findings, one issue was the fact that when we isolated equal life from the stool, only about 50% of those isolates were sensitive to the phages that were given orally. This was partially because of heterogeneity in the gut, but also because we didn't use phage sensitivity as a enrollment criteria in the design of the trial.\n\n","    Then when we looked at the phage counts, as you can see, here, it was very difficult to discern if the phages that we were seeing in a stool, which is passive transit, so the same amount that we were putting in or if these were phages, that were actually amplifying actively in the gut.\n\n","    And then lastly, with this graph on the far panel with the microbiome analysis, it might even be that eco light isn't the causative pathogen and acute eco light diarrhea, where we thought about for a long time, but now with better techniques where you can look at the microbiome. Maybe a better point of intervention could be streptococcus. But of course, if you're using specific phages for E. coli, you wouldn't be able to disrupt that outgrowth of streptococcus with an E. coli fH cocktail.\n\n","    So now let's move on to let's take that as a failure and we'll move on to the Fagor burn trial. So here the title of this paper was the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infections, infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bagdogra, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial. So again, it's this combination of doing safety and efficacy. So you can combine these phases of one and two into one. And looking at the Pico of how this trial was designed. The patient population where patients with burned wound infections caused only by Pseudomonas original song, then the intervention was a 12 page, anti Pseudomonas cocktail that was produced under GMP conditions. And that was administered seven days topically compared to standard of care.\n\n","    And then the outcomes which they were using to judge that was how long so the median time to pathogen reduction. So how fast could they see? So this compared to other trials was really using a microbiological parameter as their primary outcome compared to what we saw with other studies, which we're really looking at more patient centric measures, and then their secondary outcomes were the use of antibiotics. How much bacteria was present on the wounds, other clinical criteria, if there were secondary infections that happened after the initial burn wound infection, and if patients withdrew, what was the reason for that?\n\n","    And overall, we'll talk about some of the issues they experienced with this trial. But again, it's one of those small trials where they only had about 26 total patients and only\n\n","    where you see this different safety or MIT or pp. MIT stands for modified intention to treat population whereas p P stands for per protocol.\n\n","    And this is really when you get more into the depth of how you construct your clinical trials. It's\n\n","    which patients you use for evaluating different criteria. So safety, they evaluated everyone, and then only 25 of the 26 were used for efficacy and then the per protocol only 18 really strictly adhered to the intended clinical trial protocol.\n\n","    And if we look at the results, here, you can see this is a graph showing the time compared to the reduction and bacterial bioburden as a percentage. So in blue is the phage therapy line. And then in red is standard of care, which was an antimicrobial topical cream. And then on the x axis, you have the time. So you can see that the the curve for the standard of care is actually getting lower faster than for the phage recipients.\n\n","    And then when they looked at this, so coming back to this idea of the per protocol or the MIT, so again, per protocol, pp, are the patients that really adhered exactly to how they should have gotten the phages. And they saw that those who, who stayed in the clinical trial and really adhere to it, most of them harbored Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates that were sensitive to the phage. So this graph here is looking at the percent of isolates from the patient that were sensitive to the pages that were being applied. And then we saw that in the modified intention to treat so these were all the patients that were enrolled and looked at for for safety. There were some of them that harbored resistant colonies. And so this meaning that if you have a resistant bacterial strain, but the phages, you wouldn't expect them to work.\n\n","    And one of the major issues with this clinical trial. So I've mentioned a couple of times that this was a GMP produced phage cocktail, so good manufacturing procedures. And\n\n","    this is really an accomplishment for the field. Because normally, when you make a product for clinical use, you have to do it under GMP conditions, it's very strict and knowing the processes and the quality control for the product. So this was really great. But it was the first time anyone has done this. And what they didn't realize until a little bit too late, was that the concentration they were applying to patients was actually 1000 to almost 10,000 fold lower than what they wanted to apply to patients. And this is because they had stability problems with the phages in the cocktail. So they can't be 100% sure of the concentration that was applied. But it certainly is a reason maybe why we saw such a slow decrease in the bacterial bioburden in the wounds over time.\n\n","    So ultimately, this trial should be considered a failure as well. And then lastly, the most recently one where we saw earlier which this title is such a mouthful, so I'll say it quickly, intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer youthful resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled double blind clinical trial. Cool. So these titles are always always jam packed with information, but they are certainly a mouthful. So let's look again at the Pico criteria for this, like we did earlier and the patients were turret patients that had a UTI, then the product that they were the intervention was the commercial, Pio phage cocktail that was applied into vesicular for seven days.\n\n","    And they compare that to either placebo. So this was it the same type of solution that the phages were in, but with no phage or standard of care antibiotics, then the outcome measures they were looking at were either primary. So this was micro microbial normalization of urine cultures. Again, a microbiological primary outcome. And secondary were the clinical symptoms and safety.\n\n","    And then what you can see here is just I'll just draw your attention, this is something to really get used to, but it's an in depth concept for clinical research. So this o R is odds ratios and then you have to deal with clinical clinical intervals and the range of those and then the famous p value which we talked about earlier. So when you look at the primary outcome, which you judge your your trials of success or failure on here are the different treatment interventions, so either Pio phage, placebo or antibiotics. And this goes from anywhere between 18 to 35% of the patients were then treated successfully in terms of microbial normalization of urine cultures.\n\n","    None of the P values got anywhere close to reaching statistical significance between the treatment outcomes. And then ultimately, this trial was also deemed a failure. So if we look then at sort of all these different criteria we can have of what's important for phage clinical trial. Here you have the different trials. So either targeting all titles or equal I diarrhea, the fiber burn study, or the recent UTI publication, there's all these different things we should look at for phages. You know, do we really understand the biology of the clinical indication and that the pathogen is causing the infections, we're targeting the right and pathogen with the phages? Then a question of pre sensitivity, did we make sure that the patient's isolate is sensitive to the phages, before trying to treat them? Then another criteria is how easy is it to access the site of infection? You know, if we're talking about an infection that's right here in your ear versus a gastrointestinal problem, it's a lot easier to sample your ear than, say, your dorm room. Then we also have the question, we saw the problem with Banco burden of stability and distribution of the product of the phages. And then are we measuring correctly the effect of the phages. And if I have to pick only one, which there are usually multiple reasons for the results, that we're seeing the poor results we're observing in clinical trials for phage research, I would say the equal lie diarrhea, the main downfall was targeting equal lie when maybe equal light isn't the causing the diarrheal symptoms. Then, secondly, so this was just to go back a little minute to that here in that graph, it was really the question of if you look at yellow, which we were targeting with phages, there's only a small amount of yellow in the the relative abundance of the community. And what was really happening was this outgrowth of streptococcus. So maybe I mean, this, we'll never know. But maybe if we were targeting streptococcus, instead of Escherichia coli, we could have seen it possible effect. Then, if we move on to fiber burn, they really say that the the major issue of that trial was the stability of the phage product that was GMP produced, and this was 10,000, almost 10,000, fold less phages and that that they wanted to apply. And then with the reason trial, again, it's a question of ideology and indication and really being sure of the pathogen that you're trying to treat and making sure you've got the right phages against that.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 27:45\n\n","    Because\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:46\n\n","    I think you know, UTI is already a fairly complex situation, but they were doing this in a turret patients. So they were undergoing a surgical procedure. And this was very difficult to distinguish what was kind of happening clinically as a result of the surgery. I mean, they had some pain and some things that maybe they wouldn't have had with, with just a normal normal urinary tract infection without surgery. So if we look at the ensemble of these four completed phase two trials, they really were pioneers in their field, especially the one that was published as early as 10 years ago. That one, that Altadis trial was really the first modern Western randomized control trial for phage therapy. And then the one at Nestle was the first one being done in a pediatric population. So these were children that were sometimes only six months old. And it was really nice to see that there was some commercial interest in developing a phage product. Then the faco burned again, that was a major achievement and having a GMP produced phage product. And it was also the first multicenter trial being done in Europe. And lastly, what was nice about the UTI trial, it was a collaboration with the elliana Institute and the hospitals in Tbilisi, where phage therapy is a well known and well used medicines. So it's really great to gain some of the experience and insight of how they do phage therapy and have been doing phage therapy for so long. And last, but very importantly, is that none of these trials, despite different ages, demographics of the patients, different clinical indications, different pathogens, different pages, none of them were had any associated safety concerns with the application of phages. And this is really great. Knowing that phages seems seem to be very safe, it's still something we should always take as a priority. But with the first trials, there seems to be no risk of safety effects associated with phage therapy. However, we spend a lot of time going over that and not not\n\n","    None of these trials reach their initial full sample population. So when you design a trial and you design, how much of an effect you want to see, you say, Okay, well to see, if you wanted to see a 50% effect, this is a big effect, you wouldn't need so many patients. But if you're looking to see only a minor improvement, then you need a lot more patients. And you decide before even starting a trial, how many patients you need to be able to conclude with certainty if your intervention is achieving something or not. And not any of these trials, were able to enroll their initial intended full sample population.\n\n","    Even if the trial was deemed a success, as it was for the all Titus trial, there was no follow through to continue this further on to a commercial product.\n\n","    And all of them have these really steep learning curves, because we're really experiencing this transition from you know, a broad spectrum antibiotic that even if isn't necessarily broad spectrum, it definitely covers and kills way more bacterial species than what you would expect with phage. And I think we're still learning a lot. But hopefully, we're going to learn a lot faster and incorporate these learning lessons into future trials.\n\n","    And\n\n","    if you're familiar with some of the literature, there's there's a difference between clinical trials where we test and we do experimentation on patients, compared with case reports, or emergency use or compassionate use, where phages are often used, either in combination with antibiotics or in really severe cases. And many times we see that that can work in those one off instances.\n\n","    And just talking about where or what's happening with clinical trials, right now, with phage products, there is an ongoing phase one looking at UTI, but the only phase two clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients is a clinical trial that is being done by intelidox, which is small company in Maryland, in the United States, in cooperation with fairing pharmaceuticals, which is a Swiss company, as well as hospitals in New York. And if you want to find out more information, I would suggest this this website clinical trials.gov because they keep a very good list where you can see which phase trials are happening and pay attention though to see which ones are active versus not active.\n\n","    And you can see here what they're doing is looking at the safety and efficacy of echo active on intestinal adherent invasive equal lion patients with inactive Crohn's disease.\n\n","    So again, walk through our Pico the pot patient population is inactive Crohn's disease patients that are harboring they call this I EC, ay ay ay etc. So intestinal, adherent, invasive equal life. And so that's what they're they're looking at. And they're using phages, to see what effect that could have on this carriage and colonization with equiline News patients.\n\n","    Then they're trying to enroll 30 patients, it is a randomized and double blind trial. So they expect that it will be completed and June of next year, hopefully Corona won't have caused too much delays for their enrollment. And we look forward to seeing what the what the results of this trial.\n\n","    And then now we're at this interim where we don't have many ongoing trials. And it's really important to know what we risk by having multiple failures. So yes, we're learning a lot. But we are wasting a lot of valuable resources in terms of clinical trials are so expensive to do. And there's only a certain number of patients. And we also risk by by using patients if we're not going to use them wisely in clinical research, that it's really an ethical issue. So if you do a clinical trial, and you can't even get the number of patients that you need to to have a statistically significant conclusion,\n\n","    then you really need to think twice before starting the trial itself.\n\n","    And then also something that's super important is now right now we're experiencing a really high energy and motivation for looking at phage therapy as a valid option to antibiotics. And when we see trial after trial that's failing, we have to eventually understand what that's going to do for the reputation of either the come of specific companies or to phage therapy in general.\n\n","    And the worst thing in which something that really motivates me is that until we can go through clinical trials, we're really going to be at a loss to be able to address the clinical needs of patients and to deal with antibiotic resistant infections.\n\n","    So with that,\n\n","    The challenges we've seen with the trials are certainly the number of patients, the type of product if it's really specific for the infection you want, or can you change it if it isn't. And of course, the costs, the trial itself is expensive, the production is expensive, and the money to do those things needs to come from somewhere. Also the appropriateness of infection. So we really have to understand from a microbiological perspective, what's happening in these different infections at a much finer level than what you would need for antibiotics. And we don't at this point, have any sort of statistically significant clinical evidence that phage therapy is efficacious.\n\n","    So to move forward, I don't I don't want to end on such a negative note, because I mean, this is\n\n","    reality. But I'm still quite optimistic for the future. And I would say What we really need is more information about how phage therapy works in humans, so that when we design a clinical trial, we can use data to make these decisions. And what I really strongly suggest is that we can treat patients now who are desperately in need, and then learn from those situations in terms of what's the appropriate dose and how the patients are getting better, or what are the clinical signs we can use as markers of how to guide treatments.\n\n","    Now, regulatory support is extremely necessary for moving phage therapy forward. But I would say that most regulatory agencies have been really good to work with, they need a certain amount of data to understand and make decisions themselves. And it really is about working together to make that data and then make decisions that would allow phage therapy to develop into a medicine.\n\n","    Of course, we always make more money, many, many, many that's a that's what makes phage therapy. Well, clinical trials happen anyway. So this is something that is desperately needed in order to do more clinical trials. And then I think the priority for the community needs to be doing a proof of concept study that really demonstrates at least in some indications that phage therapy can work. And this is why we have a lot of hope for upcoming phase two trials.\n\n","    So with that, I would like to first thank you for your attention. I hope you've enjoyed that the little small lectures on the clinical aspects of phage therapy because that's really you know, when you're doing your your research and your in vitro assays, I hope this is what you keep in mind later is that hopefully someday This can help patients and I've worked with such a great amount of people and all the different photos from people up here have just been people who really share that vision as well. So thanks again and I wish you the best of luck with your studies and beach hunting and I hope you enjoy the rest of the lectures. Bye\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["ad44d67b-f87a-437d-bf59-c7de735ac9fc","c56cadd1-0511-4990-89b4-22d80e53c174","27dd6897-7197-4c8e-afb0-9b6175f5c004","c3d2454b-0c12-4cfc-b2b1-302aac089b1c","2badb935-1e2a-4850-9a23-337833fc5542","9b5c24fb-6ea5-492c-9a69-96f7d133ebda","93375d49-2d1b-4712-8d35-f70993f50085","b6a1340d-2790-47c0-989e-02b605175583","8e4b871f-44ea-4da3-ae69-21c97dc29ca0","530f513b-9d42-4100-a3d5-fa79a6359a52","e0b862b8-82ae-4980-9164-d5e8100ea1fa","e16b84a6-c108-454e-8e5c-8959c9627d32","b0ac5246-e81a-4fb4-9bb9-73102db1c77a","ad4a2a4f-5837-463c-ba1a-3a0bf23f5566","97414f59-e2d9-4533-b4b6-ea12685d1cc1","362e210a-a46a-47fd-a543-d9caeeaff788","0fbb91e6-43ca-4ceb-a7b7-6f894bbc5284","30530336-79c1-4165-8ee4-96e011e11220","4c018842-b6c3-49ff-bd2e-1b4180385056","57da1d5c-d431-4f4a-95a8-4c88a95ac70e","81e08935-c759-4498-b1de-9defdc6d679b","77407d78-60a3-4336-9ea8-666bde91bc45","937e1724-70f7-43a2-bbe8-2d1af556ce2c","93d103d8-a94a-470e-b6bf-7e54ae07796a","36812216-6e9d-4249-8017-16c81ae10851","ccb918b0-ddcf-4be9-85d6-f13e9b480723","9d4e36b4-d094-42af-bba0-494abee48b2a","f1a3842d-636f-4606-baea-95438704abc7","7cb73522-def7-4e2f-a49a-47a74b6acbdf","e2b7d2cd-692e-403f-8926-08887931acef","3f03702f-a3f3-4f97-a4fc-30860d92e55a","d798d448-48de-40f0-b27c-56692e69c2e4","cd6c7293-0826-42b7-81e8-0a15816e9f6d","8fae216b-d431-4e76-9d63-435ed16cbe3d","be9aeaf4-0958-49d7-9409-9c6fbd607b04","0c8a4bf1-078d-4ae2-8abc-cddabd19e6b5","1a00d7f7-8399-4832-bf70-246cd94c931c","e49c4ce5-26e8-497c-99b2-7fb5ecce1cb9","f9e2191c-aeeb-44ea-822e-4777dad5aa91","37ccd2fc-d77d-4e3f-8675-b10f85a10a8a","ac9eb5b6-3cc1-469c-8466-3c21f6ee2475","178ee923-e5b7-4d7d-a2c4-347bdaabbcea","84ad5f07-5516-469b-a630-750dd5a70207","e619c631-15d6-4afd-bd2b-b049c84ac9e7","b009b4e3-96f7-42c4-882e-c7037eb82a51","ec174a90-80c5-4c14-880c-42d9ec2af6d2","da737d43-28c4-4984-bc6c-ed96265a498c","634023e3-0ea7-404e-8602-0591b65abb05","8f0482cf-45bd-48a4-a568-11c074df069e","303fd9d8-887a-4826-8c91-983a9f7772f4","f70c3ad5-8c6c-4cf5-8f7f-244c32be5500","d20f2176-3be9-4a83-adfc-b6b561015a0e","268670f8-9c2e-447b-9cf0-0b8bed22ad94","57756f19-8737-4c22-906a-25ec3b85a95e","5fa48b42-a3bd-4e93-a201-c01a1aeee19d","6f46eb00-a1b0-4ff1-b218-4aa15c5e05ab","6045d0aa-268c-4c95-9c18-f95c2c069349","2026fd64-1a2d-4664-83ca-9fd49f984679","2ab7d057-b4a3-44c6-8891-cb43936e9d7a","b3981bec-8ab4-497c-8328-9783a1efdfad","9530b143-013d-4e5b-9444-70a32d0ca737","a4f10f25-adb2-4e7f-8e38-9e8472d998f2","78438a91-a87b-4031-bf0c-fcdc9f1764df","1f4d9875-de3c-4eaa-aec1-493e3ac66691","97544024-17d2-4e16-bb21-1a79479837b1","4b2e140a-40cd-47c0-871f-66296ea183ca","40da93ae-a200-4d8e-a7a6-b5265bf5817b","eec606c6-9acd-450c-b3b0-9791bef41d75","4eaed270-e34e-4ff3-a184-b97f34003f81","c568a5f6-370b-4710-ac0d-2fc02b3f3a17","f0e02cbe-b48d-4205-af53-1ab7f8928fd1","4c6f38f3-a14b-474f-8f1c-2e60d8a52503"],"content":[{"id":"ad44d67b-f87a-437d-bf59-c7de735ac9fc","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 0:00","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 0:00"]]},"parent_id":"967082ba-8a3a-4eb8-ae6f-45d8de4d2bb4","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 0:00\n\n"]},{"id":"c56cadd1-0511-4990-89b4-22d80e53c174","type":"text","value":"Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen.

So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials. Now when we look at how this falls into development for antimicrobial therapy, we know that since the 1980s, the number of new antibacterial agents being discovered and developed is drastically decreasing. So here you can see that there were about 16 new agents that were discovered in the 1980s. And then we have as few as two between 2008 and 2012. Now this is partially due to the fact that clinical trials are extremely expensive. So here you can see that the estimate is you know, 400 and $60 million. If you want to believe During a clinical drug to market, and this is just something that's extremely difficult to do. And unfortunately, antibiotics are not something that drug companies can then make a lot of money out of. So they have less of an inherent motivation to put money into a clinical trial, because they have less ability to get money back out of the drug being authorized itself. And we put this into the context of antimicrobial resistance. And we realize that we're really on the clock here, in order to develop new anti microbial therapies in order to address the problems that we're seeing with antibiotic failures. Now, we've touched a little bit here and there about the different phases of clinical trials from zero to four. And when we start at zero, this is usually just an observational study. So this is when you're not applying any type of product to a patient, you're just simply trying to look and see what the demographics or the epidemiology of your target population is. And then you can move on to safety. So this is phase one. And we said earlier that traditionally, this is done in healthy subjects. So you would be putting your product or your phages into a healthy person, and just making sure that when everything else is going well, that the drug product itself isn't causing any adverse effects. And then phase two is we're still of course, considering safety, we always consider safety. But this is when we start to look at efficacy, because now we're normally in a patient population that is afflicted by the\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:43\n\n","    the condition that we're trying to treat. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:46\n\n","    then once we move into phase three, this is really where we're trying to decide or to determine if the product is effective for treating a specific condition or not. And you have a larger population size than what you did in phase two trials. Now, it's at this point that after the completion, the successful completion of a phase three trial, that it would be possible to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. And this is really again, what companies really try to do with their drugs is because once they obtain a marketing authorization, and they're able to sell, sell, distribute and treat patients, but even after a drug or a product receives a marketing authorization, they're still phase four studies. So this is called post marketing surveillance studies. And this is when it's still\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:41\n\n","    required that the company would then follow patients who are receiving this drug over a longer amount of time to make sure that there's no adverse effects that develop on a larger scale. And we when we look at the different phases, in terms of what's been done for phage therapy, there's been a number of different phase one trials done to determine safety. And this is this will cover different types of infections. And we'll cover healthy volunteers as well as some even some patients. And this will cover a lot of different products from something as you know, as simple as a single phage, something as complex as maybe 10 or 12 pages or so there's been a number of these phase one studies done. And there's also been several efficacy studies. So these are the phase two studies that have already been completed.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:33\n\n","    And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:35\n\n","    this is really where the next section we're going to delve into these four phase two trials that have been completed for phage therapy. And if you want to have a little look and read deeper into the literature, I'll just tell you here now before we take a break, the four different publications that we'll discuss more in detail. So the first one was by right and all in 2009. And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy. Now, the second trial that was published was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to Cali phage preparations and a randomized control trial and children from Bangladesh. This was published by sarker and all in 2016. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:32\n\n","    then a third trial we have\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:34\n\n","    was the Fagor burn trial if you've ever heard of that, this is the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial This was published by jolt and all in 2019 in The Lancet, and very recently, in a trial that I was involved with was the intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer through a resection of the prostate, a randomized placebo controlled double blind trial. So all of them have these, you know, very long and complex titles. So if you're interested, you can take the time to read them individually. And I would suggest trying to look at the titles and pick out this Pico information. So the population outcome control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:29\n\n","    P. control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:33\n\n","    those letters that we talked about earlier, you can come back and look at them, but just have a look at the title. And go through and see if you can pick out yourself all of that important information. And then now We'll take a short break and I'll see you hopefully in a little bit to go over each of them then\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n"],"children":["382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","209d8623-fef9-4522-8d88-90908c0fd758"],"content":[{"id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"f51a1bf0-adf2-422d-80ed-8808a5eb51eb","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n","    Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials.

And we when we look at the different phases, in terms of what's been done for phage therapy, there's been a number of different phase one trials done to determine safety. And this is this will cover different types of infections. And we'll cover healthy volunteers as well as some even some patients. And this will cover a lot of different products from something as you know, as simple as a single phage, something as complex as maybe 10 or 12 pages or so there's been a number of these phase one studies done. And there's also been several efficacy studies. So these are the phase two studies that have already been completed.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:33\n\n","    And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:35\n\n","    this is really where the next section we're going to delve into these four phase two trials that have been completed for phage therapy. And if you want to have a little look and read deeper into the literature, I'll just tell you here now before we take a break, the four different publications that we'll discuss more in detail. So the first one was by right and all in 2009. And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy. Now, the second trial that was published was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to Cali phage preparations and a randomized control trial and children from Bangladesh. This was published by sarker and all in 2016. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:32\n\n","    then a third trial we have\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:34\n\n","    was the Fagor burn trial if you've ever heard of that, this is the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial This was published by jolt and all in 2019 in The Lancet, and very recently, in a trial that I was involved with was the intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer through a resection of the prostate, a randomized placebo controlled double blind trial. So all of them have these, you know, very long and complex titles. So if you're interested, you can take the time to read them individually. And I would suggest trying to look at the titles and pick out this Pico information. So the population outcome control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:29\n\n","    P. control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:33\n\n","    those letters that we talked about earlier, you can come back and look at them, but just have a look at the title. And go through and see if you can pick out yourself all of that important information. And then now We'll take a short break and I'll see you hopefully in a little bit to go over each of them then\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["a2b12c9f-f8dc-4897-ab42-9e9c7de639a0","ff660b54-bc11-4ffb-bb2d-e1b4afd994af","9443a535-dc5b-473c-b107-34f8706ec083","46fe2fa7-1b50-4646-9142-ee8d50e5e315","f183f1e5-dcf2-46e4-ba0d-77839b52956c","462b5626-ea5e-40df-b655-c1a4cf70f623","4976a1be-c75d-4140-934c-9fa4df70febb","f0e5e1bd-eac9-447c-981d-1f3428c872eb","1c0a9ed2-dca5-4cc2-8c65-ccad444df608","08ef6ecb-895b-4c78-8916-eec8fdf971b0","54ac1e9d-ddb4-4337-9d01-b79cf9a6f52a","54f03b4f-275d-4153-9080-0e2b9e9fa731","5ce85b4d-634d-4a87-8f20-c50b13851842","2f71924a-34f1-4c5e-817d-4ad8e2dce4e1","df6d0a12-c871-4d2f-bb84-e2b91135c3b3","0beb4dc9-95e0-40b3-a78b-90a70a36f023","c6ac39bd-f79c-4846-80a9-7377ef4f3e9b","f1eafbf9-d41b-4368-9ed3-2278e31b2d90","a0be69ce-03ce-4eb3-a936-d81c8c600b33","a265875f-f804-450b-8a48-38f29bd2bca8","0eb34d40-998f-4a45-9c56-b29c24e46900","6f50b966-cd15-4b5e-9ce1-67a9cabb040d","bcc6abdc-86b2-4add-ab72-9640cd46dc4d","9e0f8946-623d-4581-97f7-f86fb6bdbce8","515c403d-c770-4174-bc2e-d1e76be56418","2300cb27-4623-417a-a694-5c2f93d32b1a","9483c553-5171-4b2a-bc4c-27a639e3226b","5270311e-693a-42cd-bf7e-b0be1f9809a7","e7feab48-f1e6-49c2-a1cc-eb061f4b820b","86a6984c-887a-47d8-b43d-1c9c30142553","000bedff-f926-4a9c-ae70-41764c172e14","0fc6fd65-bd3f-4876-b7c6-1f6b558c4488","9a711e3b-7b68-4022-974e-a1e4cc69d398","2d871c4f-9b97-4d3a-a237-625fa3deaba6","57218270-59b7-4fb5-ac71-105eff2712e3","749bcdbf-db71-46ea-be21-929b8b97a850"],"content":[{"id":"a2b12c9f-f8dc-4897-ab42-9e9c7de639a0","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 0:01","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 0:01"]]},"parent_id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n"]},{"id":"ff660b54-bc11-4ffb-bb2d-e1b4afd994af","type":"text","value":"Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.","properties":{"title":[["Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland.

And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.","properties":{"title":[["Now, why do we do clinical trials?

And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.","properties":{"title":[["So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups.

And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection.

So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.","properties":{"title":[["And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable.

And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n"]},{"id":"54ac1e9d-ddb4-4337-9d01-b79cf9a6f52a","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 23:16","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 23:16"]]},"parent_id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n"]},{"id":"54f03b4f-275d-4153-9080-0e2b9e9fa731","type":"text","value":"And extremely importantly, is that you used","properties":{"title":[["And extremely importantly, is that you used"]]},"parent_id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","parent_table":"block","markdown":["And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n"]},{"id":"5ce85b4d-634d-4a87-8f20-c50b13851842","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 23:19","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 23:19"]]},"parent_id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n"]},{"id":"2f71924a-34f1-4c5e-817d-4ad8e2dce4e1","type":"text","value":"enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant.

The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here.

I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957. And I've also clearly demonstrated to you how you can use the micropipette to transport liquids from one container to the other. I hope this video is useful for you and help you in your microbiology research.

The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.","properties":{"title":[["Hello everyone, this is dr. john x nalli from the University of Leicester.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame. So this is me now just opening a pipette tip on the burner. And now I'm going to pour a medium into the plate. So I've got my medium which is hot and I'm now going to pour it into the plate I need to keep the plates as close to the fire as possible and the bottle as well. Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing. So whatever has descended on the tip of the bottle need to be sterilized. Now I'm going to show you how I'm going to strip out bacteria. This is a Staphylococcus aureus culture on a blue plate. And I'm going to transfer that to a stereo plate that I've just prepared. Now this plate is all set. So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200. And then you can use that micropipette on the P 200. Tip. Good.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:31\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you my diluent which is going to be assemble for you can use water in this case for your crystal violet, because what we'll be diluting is 1% crystal violates and this will just help to show the graduation or the reduction of the dilution as we go down the tubes. So I'm just opening the tube now. And I am working within a class to safety cabinet. That's why I don't have a flame with me. Now I've taken my P 1000, which is such to 900 microliters capacity. Now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tip. Now I'm going to take one tip. And I'm going to transfer. As I've shown you in my initial video, you have to press the plunger to the first stop. And now I'm going to add the quote. Now 900 microliters of my di D went into the tubes, I have to add this same quantity to all the tubes 900 microliters, of diluent. And as I've said, I'm using SM buffer. But if you do not want to waste your material, you can equally use water to dilute your crystal violet. But if you're diluting your phage, you will need to use assemble for and as you can see, I'm only allowing just the end of the tip to go into the tube do not exceed that because the only sterile part of the pipette is actually the tip. So now I'm going to put the P 1000. aside and close the eppendorf tubes containing my diluent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 7:10\n\n","    All of these contain my daily but not I'm going to pick the crystal violet that I hope to dilute and is going to be 10 for dilution, because each tube is daily diluted a tenfold to the next two. So this is the P 200 tips, which will go with my P 100. I'm going to pick a to a tip Sorry, I'm going to press it to the first plunger. Do not exceed that, or else you're going to take excess amount. So I'm now open my crystal violet. And I'm going to add that to the first tube which is the minus one tube. I'm going to resuspend that couple of time. And I'm going to throw away that pipette tip. After discarding, I will take a fresh tip and transfer material from the minus one\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 8:26\n\n","    tube\n\n","    Janet Nale 8:34\n\n","    into the minus two tube. And I'm going to resuspend that by putting up and down a couple of times to resuspend. And to equally distribute the crystal violet. I've discarded the initial tip and picked a fresh one. Now I'm going to go in to the minus two tube and take 100 microliters in there and that will be transferred into minus three tube. Now discard it again and pay the fresh tip and not open the minus three and that is how I'm going to do until the crystal violet is diluted tenfold across the tubes. So all you're doing is just gradually diluting your initial stock sample reducing the numbers with the amount by a tenfold Just remember to keep changing the tip as you dilute.\n\n","    Janet Nale 9:58\n\n","    That is the minor six We are graduating to minus seven MCs. Good to take that. And now we have added to the minus eight, you may choose to eliminate 100 microliters from the minus minus eight to ensure you've got equal amount. But for this case, this is unnecessary. So I'm just showing you the graduation of the color of the crystal violet within the tube. And as you can see, by the time we get to minus eight, it is basically\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 10:42\n\n","    reduced\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:44\n\n","    drastically to a clear liquid. So for us to actually see this in a visual way, I've now put 96 well plate culture played out. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters of the diluted crystal violet into the well. So I'm just changing the volume setting till I get 200 microliters. So this is p 200 p pet. So it's set. So to 200. So these are my tips, the p p 200. Tips, which will match my P 200. Micro micro pipette. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters to each of the wells. So I'm going to press again the plunger to the first stop. So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n"],"children":["cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","8dd96423-b5ca-4433-bb14-c635df7e0704"],"content":[{"id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"e6b5c475-067b-4ebd-8362-5c8a0a07b510","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:06\n\n","    Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","2c9f9bce-f342-4c2b-8bfc-7a8fafce4544","5c128188-4fab-4349-b761-089a6b8b314a","3ef5090e-9b62-4960-b40e-7d6b1d099a08","ff484326-0c5c-40cf-987d-80a912a7adaf","6ec64614-6d86-4e3e-8f1b-a653ccdfdb63","49eb0cbf-f40c-4062-ba65-fc4cd25d6d0c","895dc0e1-09ac-464d-81ac-6cc34dcf0817","9a52503d-ed10-4ee8-b18e-ff13a094924b","5f1704f0-df56-414d-b786-8a2b6dd1ad4e","3791ee6e-06ee-4311-b371-ab7bb8ece87f","1f971023-b531-41f3-8a9d-bc0e09f84c94","c0f2b33b-f907-4ad9-a9c7-c69aa34accbf","4002a578-0879-4631-bc49-d17fc4f1d4f8","92badb7c-6d05-4919-a75e-0642123a16f9","7cc5d10b-c74e-4e41-b6c8-3d7e875dad12","5bd83d34-7771-4041-b8e9-1d51ed98f488"],"content":[{"id":"24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 0:06","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 0:06"]]},"parent_id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 0:06\n\n"]},{"id":"852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","type":"text","value":"Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight.

In this video, we are going to apply our knowledge on serial dilution to be able to enumerate a phage. So if you haven't seen my previous video on how I use crystal violet, diluting it to decreasing concentration, please, I will really recommend that you have a look at that video because that will greatly help in the understanding of the serial dilution that we are going to conduct now on the phage. So I'm going to dilute this page because I need to enumerate the number of phage, or the concentration of phage within this feature lysate that I have got. So I have got a universal truth here containing some phage. So now I'm going to I have already added SM buffer into the tube. And because I'm going to do my dilution in one meal that is 1000 microliters, I have added 900 microliters of the SM buffer into each of the tubes shown in the video. So I've labeled that minus one to minus eight. And I've picked my P 1000 micropipette. And I've set it to 100 microliters. And now I'm going to use my P 200. Tips, which will fit my P 100. micropipette. I'm going to take one of each and transfer 100 microliters. So if you refer back to my video, the crystal violet, I have to use the same method to dilute the crystal violet. And this is a 10 fold serial dilution. So 100 microliters of the phage lysate is going to be transferred to my first tube containing my 900 microliters of the diamond which is SM buffer and I'm mixing it by pipetting up and down just a couple of times using the plunger. I'm going to throw that tip away. And I'm going to take a fresh tip you have to change the tip because you're moving for from a higher concentration to a lower concentration or in your diner. And so I've just aspirated 100 microliters of the minus one diluted sample, and I've added it to the minus two tube, mix it throw away the tape, I'm not taking a fresh tip, and going in to the minus two tube aspirating 100 microliters and then adding that to the minus three tube. And I'm just mixed it might be putting up and down, threw away that pipette tip and then taking the minus three removing hundred microliters into minus four. So this is just diluting my phage from a very high concentration to low concentration in a systematic way using 10 fold dilution methods. And it is reducing my phage to a certain amount that I will be able to count. Now I'm adding from the minus five to minus six. throwing away the pet got fresh pet back to minus six. Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight. So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections.

So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections. Thank you\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["cd339060-773e-43db-8788-d767b01ca0cb","27cba1a7-e764-4963-b67e-360b79efd5b5","52652128-5a30-4916-85d1-6e7b9c7705e4","4a0adb0a-3bd2-489b-982b-d93e8a4e9cdd","8331f157-f4e0-4572-a722-d4634a0d41f4","40c94dab-a278-4154-b55b-cae86d8ce2fe","945ff7ed-5ee4-492c-a0b4-511f3e63988b","8b6c4392-4800-4e12-87bc-ea0cf9885a9d","0350434d-ce5e-4526-b9a4-b9543e205d5b","569412a8-60a8-41ef-8bd0-d9154a25f002","b98203e9-72a8-4c09-968d-d4d2547ccda5","39d5eae2-f522-4705-98bf-c74d4c0cacbc","9eab8ab9-ba91-41f0-ac31-045ad1e00e9a","6904cf8e-f0e1-4e1c-bdfc-242d55f77324","efede8fe-9c15-4ab9-8550-f44c1eda8e89","8c71cd8f-ca15-48ae-afb6-fe85de9e1d39","9a494394-cdcb-4c89-b39f-d9716418e43e"],"content":[{"id":"cd339060-773e-43db-8788-d767b01ca0cb","type":"text","parent_id":"c12eb519-8872-4d46-93a1-2b65a4e718d5","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"27cba1a7-e764-4963-b67e-360b79efd5b5","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 0:01","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 0:01"]]},"parent_id":"c12eb519-8872-4d46-93a1-2b65a4e718d5","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 0:01\n\n"]},{"id":"52652128-5a30-4916-85d1-6e7b9c7705e4","type":"text","value":"Hello, everyone is Dennis nalli back again with another video.

Because it is very important to understand what I did in that previous video for you to be able to understand and interpret the result we are going to see here. So just to recap, in that previous video, all I did was to conduct 10 for serial dilution of a phage in SM buffer, and then supported 10 microliters. of the serially diluted phage on a lawn of a bacterium, I cultured the whole setup in 37 degrees centigrade overnight. And now I'm going to check the plates. So this is the plate. And if you remember the plate, I divided it into eight different sections. And as you can see, you can see Clarence on the lawn, so around the area where I did not sport, you would see cloudiness. And this just shows the bacteria has grown. So this is the first thing you want to look for. Because if you don't have a good loan, you will not have a good spot test because there will be no bacteria for your phage to infect so you can see the zone of clearance. And you can see complete clearance from the minus one because you have more fish there are reduced clearance or plaques across till you got to the minus six. So this is a type of results you are expecting to see if you conduct your serial dilution correctly. So in my next video, I'm going to show you how I will calculate the plaque forming unit of these phage that I have just enumerated. I'll see you in that video.
