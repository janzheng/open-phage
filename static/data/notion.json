<summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n","    Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials. Now when we look at how this falls into development for antimicrobial therapy, we know that since the 1980s, the number of new antibacterial agents being discovered and developed is drastically decreasing. So here you can see that there were about 16 new agents that were discovered in the 1980s. And then we have as few as two between 2008 and 2012. Now this is partially due to the fact that clinical trials are extremely expensive. So here you can see that the estimate is you know, 400 and $60 million. If you want to believe During a clinical drug to market, and this is just something that's extremely difficult to do. And unfortunately, antibiotics are not something that drug companies can then make a lot of money out of. So they have less of an inherent motivation to put money into a clinical trial, because they have less ability to get money back out of the drug being authorized itself. And we put this into the context of antimicrobial resistance. And we realize that we're really on the clock here, in order to develop new anti microbial therapies in order to address the problems that we're seeing with antibiotic failures. Now, we've touched a little bit here and there about the different phases of clinical trials from zero to four. And when we start at zero, this is usually just an observational study. So this is when you're not applying any type of product to a patient, you're just simply trying to look and see what the demographics or the epidemiology of your target population is. And then you can move on to safety. So this is phase one. And we said earlier that traditionally, this is done in healthy subjects. So you would be putting your product or your phages into a healthy person, and just making sure that when everything else is going well, that the drug product itself isn't causing any adverse effects. And then phase two is we're still of course, considering safety, we always consider safety. But this is when we start to look at efficacy, because now we're normally in a patient population that is afflicted by the\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:43\n\n","    the condition that we're trying to treat. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:46\n\n","    then once we move into phase three, this is really where we're trying to decide or to determine if the product is effective for treating a specific condition or not. And you have a larger population size than what you did in phase two trials. Now, it's at this point that after the completion, the successful completion of a phase three trial, that it would be possible to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. And this is really again, what companies really try to do with their drugs is because once they obtain a marketing authorization, and they're able to sell, sell, distribute and treat patients, but even after a drug or a product receives a marketing authorization, they're still phase four studies. So this is called post marketing surveillance studies. And this is when it's still\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:41\n\n","    required that the company would then follow patients who are receiving this drug over a longer amount of time to make sure that there's no adverse effects that develop on a larger scale. And we when we look at the different phases, in terms of what's been done for phage therapy, there's been a number of different phase one trials done to determine safety. And this is this will cover different types of infections. And we'll cover healthy volunteers as well as some even some patients. And this will cover a lot of different products from something as you know, as simple as a single phage, something as complex as maybe 10 or 12 pages or so there's been a number of these phase one studies done. And there's also been several efficacy studies. So these are the phase two studies that have already been completed.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:33\n\n","    And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:35\n\n","    this is really where the next section we're going to delve into these four phase two trials that have been completed for phage therapy.

So the first one was by right and all in 2009. And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy.

So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials. Now when we look at how this falls into development for antimicrobial therapy, we know that since the 1980s, the number of new antibacterial agents being discovered and developed is drastically decreasing. So here you can see that there were about 16 new agents that were discovered in the 1980s. And then we have as few as two between 2008 and 2012. Now this is partially due to the fact that clinical trials are extremely expensive. So here you can see that the estimate is you know, 400 and $60 million. If you want to believe During a clinical drug to market, and this is just something that's extremely difficult to do. And unfortunately, antibiotics are not something that drug companies can then make a lot of money out of. So they have less of an inherent motivation to put money into a clinical trial, because they have less ability to get money back out of the drug being authorized itself. And we put this into the context of antimicrobial resistance. And we realize that we're really on the clock here, in order to develop new anti microbial therapies in order to address the problems that we're seeing with antibiotic failures. Now, we've touched a little bit here and there about the different phases of clinical trials from zero to four. And when we start at zero, this is usually just an observational study. So this is when you're not applying any type of product to a patient, you're just simply trying to look and see what the demographics or the epidemiology of your target population is. And then you can move on to safety. So this is phase one. And we said earlier that traditionally, this is done in healthy subjects. So you would be putting your product or your phages into a healthy person, and just making sure that when everything else is going well, that the drug product itself isn't causing any adverse effects. And then phase two is we're still of course, considering safety, we always consider safety. But this is when we start to look at efficacy, because now we're normally in a patient population that is afflicted by the\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:43\n\n","    the condition that we're trying to treat. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:46\n\n","    then once we move into phase three, this is really where we're trying to decide or to determine if the product is effective for treating a specific condition or not. And you have a larger population size than what you did in phase two trials. Now, it's at this point that after the completion, the successful completion of a phase three trial, that it would be possible to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. And this is really again, what companies really try to do with their drugs is because once they obtain a marketing authorization, and they're able to sell, sell, distribute and treat patients, but even after a drug or a product receives a marketing authorization, they're still phase four studies. So this is called post marketing surveillance studies. And this is when it's still\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:41\n\n","    required that the company would then follow patients who are receiving this drug over a longer amount of time to make sure that there's no adverse effects that develop on a larger scale. And we when we look at the different phases, in terms of what's been done for phage therapy, there's been a number of different phase one trials done to determine safety. And this is this will cover different types of infections. And we'll cover healthy volunteers as well as some even some patients. And this will cover a lot of different products from something as you know, as simple as a single phage, something as complex as maybe 10 or 12 pages or so there's been a number of these phase one studies done. And there's also been several efficacy studies. So these are the phase two studies that have already been completed.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:33\n\n","    And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:35\n\n","    this is really where the next section we're going to delve into these four phase two trials that have been completed for phage therapy. And if you want to have a little look and read deeper into the literature, I'll just tell you here now before we take a break, the four different publications that we'll discuss more in detail. So the first one was by right and all in 2009. And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy.

So all of them have these, you know, very long and complex titles. So if you're interested, you can take the time to read them individually. And I would suggest trying to look at the titles and pick out this Pico information.

So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.","properties":{"title":[["Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland.

And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.","properties":{"title":[["Now, why do we do clinical trials?

And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will.

And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data."]]},"parent_id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","parent_table":"block","markdown":["So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy.

And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection.

So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.","properties":{"title":[["And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable.

\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:01\n\n","    Hello everyone, this is dr. john x nalli from the University of Leicester. The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here. The liquid I'm going to transfer is an SM buffer in a falcon tube I have got my P 1000 tips. Remember these will go with the p 1000 p pets. Now, I intend to transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer into the end of chip. So I'm going to take my P 1000 compact\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:31\n\n","    and I just the controller 250.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:35\n\n","    Remember I told you that the numbers on the controller is one digit short. So the 50 is 500 microliters of volume of whatever liquid I'm going to transfer.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:59\n\n","    I'm now going to press the plunger\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:03\n\n","    to the first stop\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:10\n\n","    and push the tip of the micropipette into one of the pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:21\n\n","    While the plunger is still down,\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:27\n\n","    I'm going to insert the tip\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:31\n\n","    just touching the SM buffer remember not to go beyond the pipette tip into whatever bottle or two that you are taking the material from. Once I release the plunger I have already aspirated the platform but microliters and by pressing back the plunger to the first stop, I will not release the material into the eppendorf tube. I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957. And I've also clearly demonstrated to you how you can use the micropipette to transport liquids from one container to the other. I hope this video is useful for you and help you in your microbiology research.

And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n"]},{"id":"cee47531-83b5-47ed-8e84-1aa01040a921","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 4:33","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 4:33"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 4:33\n\n"]},{"id":"e0cb2b56-4984-43cc-9dcd-b0849253a901","type":"text","value":"Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid","properties":{"title":[["Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n"]},{"id":"d08a05a1-bd92-4e58-8bcb-1a556a4408aa","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 4:41","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 4:41"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 4:41\n\n"]},{"id":"e910c635-ed2a-4b95-875d-e0c48259f67a","type":"text","value":"into","properties":{"title":[["into"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["into\n\n"]},{"id":"da5d5d2e-48aa-428e-833e-d982dd435c1e","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 4:43","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 4:43"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 4:43\n\n"]},{"id":"b545fb54-e9d1-4c45-851b-48c4891e6054","type":"text","value":"a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame. So this is me now just opening a pipette tip on the burner. And now I'm going to pour a medium into the plate. So I've got my medium which is hot and I'm now going to pour it into the plate I need to keep the plates as close to the fire as possible and the bottle as well. Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing. So whatever has descended on the tip of the bottle need to be sterilized. Now I'm going to show you how I'm going to strip out bacteria. This is a Staphylococcus aureus culture on a blue plate. And I'm going to transfer that to a stereo plate that I've just prepared. Now this plate is all set. So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing. So whatever has descended on the tip of the bottle need to be sterilized. Now I'm going to show you how I'm going to strip out bacteria. This is a Staphylococcus aureus culture on a blue plate. And I'm going to transfer that to a stereo plate that I've just prepared. Now this plate is all set. So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200.

So I'm just opening the tube now. And I am working within a class to safety cabinet. That's why I don't have a flame with me. Now I've taken my P 1000, which is such to 900 microliters capacity. Now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tip. Now I'm going to take one tip. And I'm going to transfer. As I've shown you in my initial video, you have to press the plunger to the first stop. And now I'm going to add the quote. Now 900 microliters of my di D went into the tubes, I have to add this same quantity to all the tubes 900 microliters, of diluent. And as I've said, I'm using SM buffer. But if you do not want to waste your material, you can equally use water to dilute your crystal violet. But if you're diluting your phage, you will need to use assemble for and as you can see, I'm only allowing just the end of the tip to go into the tube do not exceed that because the only sterile part of the pipette is actually the tip.

So I'm now open my crystal violet. And I'm going to add that to the first tube which is the minus one tube. I'm going to resuspend that couple of time. And I'm going to throw away that pipette tip.

Now discard it again and pay the fresh tip and not open the minus three and that is how I'm going to do until the crystal violet is diluted tenfold across the tubes.

Micro micro pipette. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters to each of the wells. So I'm going to press again the plunger to the first stop. So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent.

And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200. And then you can use that micropipette on the P 200. Tip.

In this video, we are going to apply our knowledge on serial dilution to be able to enumerate a phage. So if you haven't seen my previous video on how I use crystal violet, diluting it to decreasing concentration, please, I will really recommend that you have a look at that video because that will greatly help in the understanding of the serial dilution that we are going to conduct now on the phage. So I'm going to dilute this page because I need to enumerate the number of phage, or the concentration of phage within this feature lysate that I have got. So I have got a universal truth here containing some phage. So now I'm going to I have already added SM buffer into the tube. And because I'm going to do my dilution in one meal that is 1000 microliters, I have added 900 microliters of the SM buffer into each of the tubes shown in the video. So I've labeled that minus one to minus eight. And I've picked my P 1000 micropipette. And I've set it to 100 microliters. And now I'm going to use my P 200. Tips, which will fit my P 100. micropipette. I'm going to take one of each and transfer 100 microliters. So if you refer back to my video, the crystal violet, I have to use the same method to dilute the crystal violet. And this is a 10 fold serial dilution. So 100 microliters of the phage lysate is going to be transferred to my first tube containing my 900 microliters of the diamond which is SM buffer and I'm mixing it by pipetting up and down just a couple of times using the plunger. I'm going to throw that tip away. And I'm going to take a fresh tip you have to change the tip because you're moving for from a higher concentration to a lower concentration or in your diner. And so I've just aspirated 100 microliters of the minus one diluted sample, and I've added it to the minus two tube, mix it throw away the tape, I'm not taking a fresh tip, and going in to the minus two tube aspirating 100 microliters and then adding that to the minus three tube. And I'm just mixed it might be putting up and down, threw away that pipette tip and then taking the minus three removing hundred microliters into minus four. So this is just diluting my phage from a very high concentration to low concentration in a systematic way using 10 fold dilution methods. And it is reducing my phage to a certain amount that I will be able to count. Now I'm adding from the minus five to minus six. throwing away the pet got fresh pet back to minus six. Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight. So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections.

So I've labeled that minus one to minus eight. And I've picked my P 1000 micropipette. And I've set it to 100 microliters. And now I'm going to use my P 200. Tips, which will fit my P 100. micropipette. I'm going to take one of each and transfer 100 microliters. So if you refer back to my video, the crystal violet, I have to use the same method to dilute the crystal violet. And this is a 10 fold serial dilution. So 100 microliters of the phage lysate is going to be transferred to my first tube containing my 900 microliters of the diamond which is SM buffer and I'm mixing it by pipetting up and down just a couple of times using the plunger. I'm going to throw that tip away. And I'm going to take a fresh tip you have to change the tip because you're moving for from a higher concentration to a lower concentration or in your diner. And so I've just aspirated 100 microliters of the minus one diluted sample, and I've added it to the minus two tube, mix it throw away the tape, I'm not taking a fresh tip, and going in to the minus two tube aspirating 100 microliters and then adding that to the minus three tube. And I'm just mixed it might be putting up and down, threw away that pipette tip and then taking the minus three removing hundred microliters into minus four. So this is just diluting my phage from a very high concentration to low concentration in a systematic way using 10 fold dilution methods. And it is reducing my phage to a certain amount that I will be able to count. Now I'm adding from the minus five to minus six. throwing away the pet got fresh pet back to minus six. Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight.

In this video, we are going to apply our knowledge on serial dilution to be able to enumerate a phage.

In this video, I'm going to show you the results of the phage dilution and titer ring that I conducted in my previous video. If you haven't seen that video, I highly recommend it for you. Because it is very important to understand what I did in that previous video for you to be able to understand and interpret the result we are going to see here. So just to recap, in that previous video, all I did was to conduct 10 for serial dilution of a phage in SM buffer, and then supported 10 microliters. of the serially diluted phage on a lawn of a bacterium, I cultured the whole setup in 37 degrees centigrade overnight. And now I'm going to check the plates. So this is the plate. And if you remember the plate, I divided it into eight different sections. And as you can see, you can see Clarence on the lawn, so around the area where I did not sport, you would see cloudiness. And this just shows the bacteria has grown. So this is the first thing you want to look for. Because if you don't have a good loan, you will not have a good spot test because there will be no bacteria for your phage to infect so you can see the zone of clearance. And you can see complete clearance from the minus one because you have more fish there are reduced clearance or plaques across till you got to the minus six. So this is a type of results you are expecting to see if you conduct your serial dilution correctly. So in my next video, I'm going to show you how I will calculate the plaque forming unit of these phage that I have just enumerated. I'll see you in that video.

Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials. Now when we look at how this falls into development for antimicrobial therapy, we know that since the 1980s, the number of new antibacterial agents being discovered and developed is drastically decreasing. So here you can see that there were about 16 new agents that were discovered in the 1980s. And then we have as few as two between 2008 and 2012. Now this is partially due to the fact that clinical trials are extremely expensive. So here you can see that the estimate is you know, 400 and $60 million. If you want to believe During a clinical drug to market, and this is just something that's extremely difficult to do. And unfortunately, antibiotics are not something that drug companies can then make a lot of money out of. So they have less of an inherent motivation to put money into a clinical trial, because they have less ability to get money back out of the drug being authorized itself. And we put this into the context of antimicrobial resistance. And we realize that we're really on the clock here, in order to develop new anti microbial therapies in order to address the problems that we're seeing with antibiotic failures. Now, we've touched a little bit here and there about the different phases of clinical trials from zero to four. And when we start at zero, this is usually just an observational study. So this is when you're not applying any type of product to a patient, you're just simply trying to look and see what the demographics or the epidemiology of your target population is. And then you can move on to safety. So this is phase one. And we said earlier that traditionally, this is done in healthy subjects. So you would be putting your product or your phages into a healthy person, and just making sure that when everything else is going well, that the drug product itself isn't causing any adverse effects. And then phase two is we're still of course, considering safety, we always consider safety. But this is when we start to look at efficacy, because now we're normally in a patient population that is afflicted by the\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:43\n\n","    the condition that we're trying to treat. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:46\n\n","    then once we move into phase three, this is really where we're trying to decide or to determine if the product is effective for treating a specific condition or not. And you have a larger population size than what you did in phase two trials. Now, it's at this point that after the completion, the successful completion of a phase three trial, that it would be possible to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. And this is really again, what companies really try to do with their drugs is because once they obtain a marketing authorization, and they're able to sell, sell, distribute and treat patients, but even after a drug or a product receives a marketing authorization, they're still phase four studies. So this is called post marketing surveillance studies. And this is when it's still\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:41\n\n","    required that the company would then follow patients who are receiving this drug over a longer amount of time to make sure that there's no adverse effects that develop on a larger scale. And we when we look at the different phases, in terms of what's been done for phage therapy, there's been a number of different phase one trials done to determine safety. And this is this will cover different types of infections. And we'll cover healthy volunteers as well as some even some patients. And this will cover a lot of different products from something as you know, as simple as a single phage, something as complex as maybe 10 or 12 pages or so there's been a number of these phase one studies done. And there's also been several efficacy studies. So these are the phase two studies that have already been completed.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:33\n\n","    And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:35\n\n","    this is really where the next section we're going to delve into these four phase two trials that have been completed for phage therapy. And if you want to have a little look and read deeper into the literature, I'll just tell you here now before we take a break, the four different publications that we'll discuss more in detail. So the first one was by right and all in 2009. And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy. Now, the second trial that was published was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to Cali phage preparations and a randomized control trial and children from Bangladesh. This was published by sarker and all in 2016. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:32\n\n","    then a third trial we have\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:34\n\n","    was the Fagor burn trial if you've ever heard of that, this is the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial This was published by jolt and all in 2019 in The Lancet, and very recently, in a trial that I was involved with was the intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer through a resection of the prostate, a randomized placebo controlled double blind trial. So all of them have these, you know, very long and complex titles. So if you're interested, you can take the time to read them individually. And I would suggest trying to look at the titles and pick out this Pico information. So the population outcome control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:29\n\n","    P. control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:33\n\n","    those letters that we talked about earlier, you can come back and look at them, but just have a look at the title. And go through and see if you can pick out yourself all of that important information. And then now We'll take a short break and I'll see you hopefully in a little bit to go over each of them then\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n"],"children":["382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","209d8623-fef9-4522-8d88-90908c0fd758"],"content":[{"id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"f51a1bf0-adf2-422d-80ed-8808a5eb51eb","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n","    Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland.

And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials. Now when we look at how this falls into development for antimicrobial therapy, we know that since the 1980s, the number of new antibacterial agents being discovered and developed is drastically decreasing. So here you can see that there were about 16 new agents that were discovered in the 1980s. And then we have as few as two between 2008 and 2012. Now this is partially due to the fact that clinical trials are extremely expensive. So here you can see that the estimate is you know, 400 and $60 million. If you want to believe During a clinical drug to market, and this is just something that's extremely difficult to do. And unfortunately, antibiotics are not something that drug companies can then make a lot of money out of. So they have less of an inherent motivation to put money into a clinical trial, because they have less ability to get money back out of the drug being authorized itself. And we put this into the context of antimicrobial resistance. And we realize that we're really on the clock here, in order to develop new anti microbial therapies in order to address the problems that we're seeing with antibiotic failures. Now, we've touched a little bit here and there about the different phases of clinical trials from zero to four. And when we start at zero, this is usually just an observational study. So this is when you're not applying any type of product to a patient, you're just simply trying to look and see what the demographics or the epidemiology of your target population is. And then you can move on to safety. So this is phase one. And we said earlier that traditionally, this is done in healthy subjects. So you would be putting your product or your phages into a healthy person, and just making sure that when everything else is going well, that the drug product itself isn't causing any adverse effects. And then phase two is we're still of course, considering safety, we always consider safety. But this is when we start to look at efficacy, because now we're normally in a patient population that is afflicted by the\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:43\n\n","    the condition that we're trying to treat. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:46\n\n","    then once we move into phase three, this is really where we're trying to decide or to determine if the product is effective for treating a specific condition or not. And you have a larger population size than what you did in phase two trials. Now, it's at this point that after the completion, the successful completion of a phase three trial, that it would be possible to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. And this is really again, what companies really try to do with their drugs is because once they obtain a marketing authorization, and they're able to sell, sell, distribute and treat patients, but even after a drug or a product receives a marketing authorization, they're still phase four studies. So this is called post marketing surveillance studies. And this is when it's still\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:41\n\n","    required that the company would then follow patients who are receiving this drug over a longer amount of time to make sure that there's no adverse effects that develop on a larger scale. And we when we look at the different phases, in terms of what's been done for phage therapy, there's been a number of different phase one trials done to determine safety. And this is this will cover different types of infections. And we'll cover healthy volunteers as well as some even some patients. And this will cover a lot of different products from something as you know, as simple as a single phage, something as complex as maybe 10 or 12 pages or so there's been a number of these phase one studies done. And there's also been several efficacy studies. So these are the phase two studies that have already been completed.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:33\n\n","    And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:35\n\n","    this is really where the next section we're going to delve into these four phase two trials that have been completed for phage therapy. And if you want to have a little look and read deeper into the literature, I'll just tell you here now before we take a break, the four different publications that we'll discuss more in detail. So the first one was by right and all in 2009. And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy. Now, the second trial that was published was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to Cali phage preparations and a randomized control trial and children from Bangladesh. This was published by sarker and all in 2016. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:32\n\n","    then a third trial we have\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:34\n\n","    was the Fagor burn trial if you've ever heard of that, this is the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial This was published by jolt and all in 2019 in The Lancet, and very recently, in a trial that I was involved with was the intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer through a resection of the prostate, a randomized placebo controlled double blind trial. So all of them have these, you know, very long and complex titles. So if you're interested, you can take the time to read them individually. And I would suggest trying to look at the titles and pick out this Pico information. So the population outcome control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:29\n\n","    P. control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:33\n\n","    those letters that we talked about earlier, you can come back and look at them, but just have a look at the title. And go through and see if you can pick out yourself all of that important information. And then now We'll take a short break and I'll see you hopefully in a little bit to go over each of them then\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["a2b12c9f-f8dc-4897-ab42-9e9c7de639a0","ff660b54-bc11-4ffb-bb2d-e1b4afd994af","9443a535-dc5b-473c-b107-34f8706ec083","46fe2fa7-1b50-4646-9142-ee8d50e5e315","f183f1e5-dcf2-46e4-ba0d-77839b52956c","462b5626-ea5e-40df-b655-c1a4cf70f623","4976a1be-c75d-4140-934c-9fa4df70febb","f0e5e1bd-eac9-447c-981d-1f3428c872eb","1c0a9ed2-dca5-4cc2-8c65-ccad444df608","08ef6ecb-895b-4c78-8916-eec8fdf971b0","54ac1e9d-ddb4-4337-9d01-b79cf9a6f52a","54f03b4f-275d-4153-9080-0e2b9e9fa731","5ce85b4d-634d-4a87-8f20-c50b13851842","2f71924a-34f1-4c5e-817d-4ad8e2dce4e1","df6d0a12-c871-4d2f-bb84-e2b91135c3b3","0beb4dc9-95e0-40b3-a78b-90a70a36f023","c6ac39bd-f79c-4846-80a9-7377ef4f3e9b","f1eafbf9-d41b-4368-9ed3-2278e31b2d90","a0be69ce-03ce-4eb3-a936-d81c8c600b33","a265875f-f804-450b-8a48-38f29bd2bca8","0eb34d40-998f-4a45-9c56-b29c24e46900","6f50b966-cd15-4b5e-9ce1-67a9cabb040d","bcc6abdc-86b2-4add-ab72-9640cd46dc4d","9e0f8946-623d-4581-97f7-f86fb6bdbce8","515c403d-c770-4174-bc2e-d1e76be56418","2300cb27-4623-417a-a694-5c2f93d32b1a","9483c553-5171-4b2a-bc4c-27a639e3226b","5270311e-693a-42cd-bf7e-b0be1f9809a7","e7feab48-f1e6-49c2-a1cc-eb061f4b820b","86a6984c-887a-47d8-b43d-1c9c30142553","000bedff-f926-4a9c-ae70-41764c172e14","0fc6fd65-bd3f-4876-b7c6-1f6b558c4488","9a711e3b-7b68-4022-974e-a1e4cc69d398","2d871c4f-9b97-4d3a-a237-625fa3deaba6","57218270-59b7-4fb5-ac71-105eff2712e3","749bcdbf-db71-46ea-be21-929b8b97a850"],"content":[{"id":"a2b12c9f-f8dc-4897-ab42-9e9c7de639a0","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 0:01","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 0:01"]]},"parent_id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n"]},{"id":"ff660b54-bc11-4ffb-bb2d-e1b4afd994af","type":"text","value":"Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.","properties":{"title":[["Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases.

And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.","properties":{"title":[["Now, why do we do clinical trials?

And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will.

And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it.

So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.","properties":{"title":[["And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable.

So here you can see that there were about 16 new agents that were discovered in the 1980s. And then we have as few as two between 2008 and 2012. Now this is partially due to the fact that clinical trials are extremely expensive. So here you can see that the estimate is you know, 400 and $60 million. If you want to believe During a clinical drug to market, and this is just something that's extremely difficult to do. And unfortunately, antibiotics are not something that drug companies can then make a lot of money out of. So they have less of an inherent motivation to put money into a clinical trial, because they have less ability to get money back out of the drug being authorized itself. And we put this into the context of antimicrobial resistance. And we realize that we're really on the clock here, in order to develop new anti microbial therapies in order to address the problems that we're seeing with antibiotic failures. Now, we've touched a little bit here and there about the different phases of clinical trials from zero to four. And when we start at zero, this is usually just an observational study. So this is when you're not applying any type of product to a patient, you're just simply trying to look and see what the demographics or the epidemiology of your target population is. And then you can move on to safety. So this is phase one. And we said earlier that traditionally, this is done in healthy subjects. So you would be putting your product or your phages into a healthy person, and just making sure that when everything else is going well, that the drug product itself isn't causing any adverse effects. And then phase two is we're still of course, considering safety, we always consider safety. But this is when we start to look at efficacy, because now we're normally in a patient population that is afflicted by the\n\n"]},{"id":"a0be69ce-03ce-4eb3-a936-d81c8c600b33","type":"text","value":"Shawna McCallin 26:43","properties":{"title":[["Shawna McCallin 26:43"]]},"parent_id":"382cf52d-7b7a-4a6a-879e-c87aea5655aa","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Shawna McCallin 26:43\n\n"]},{"id":"a265875f-f804-450b-8a48-38f29bd2bca8","type":"text","value":"the condition that we're trying to treat.

\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:01\n\n","    Hello everyone, this is dr. john x nalli from the University of Leicester. The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here. The liquid I'm going to transfer is an SM buffer in a falcon tube I have got my P 1000 tips. Remember these will go with the p 1000 p pets. Now, I intend to transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer into the end of chip. So I'm going to take my P 1000 compact\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:31\n\n","    and I just the controller 250.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:35\n\n","    Remember I told you that the numbers on the controller is one digit short. So the 50 is 500 microliters of volume of whatever liquid I'm going to transfer.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:59\n\n","    I'm now going to press the plunger\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:03\n\n","    to the first stop\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:10\n\n","    and push the tip of the micropipette into one of the pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:21\n\n","    While the plunger is still down,\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:27\n\n","    I'm going to insert the tip\n\n","    Janet Nale 6:31\n\n","    just touching the SM buffer remember not to go beyond the pipette tip into whatever bottle or two that you are taking the material from. Once I release the plunger I have already aspirated the platform but microliters and by pressing back the plunger to the first stop, I will not release the material into the eppendorf tube. I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957. And I've also clearly demonstrated to you how you can use the micropipette to transport liquids from one container to the other. I hope this video is useful for you and help you in your microbiology research.

This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n"]},{"id":"cee47531-83b5-47ed-8e84-1aa01040a921","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 4:33","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 4:33"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 4:33\n\n"]},{"id":"e0cb2b56-4984-43cc-9dcd-b0849253a901","type":"text","value":"Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid","properties":{"title":[["Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n"]},{"id":"d08a05a1-bd92-4e58-8bcb-1a556a4408aa","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 4:41","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 4:41"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 4:41\n\n"]},{"id":"e910c635-ed2a-4b95-875d-e0c48259f67a","type":"text","value":"into","properties":{"title":[["into"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["into\n\n"]},{"id":"da5d5d2e-48aa-428e-833e-d982dd435c1e","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 4:43","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 4:43"]]},"parent_id":"fa268417-03cb-4dcb-823d-74530b113a49","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 4:43\n\n"]},{"id":"b545fb54-e9d1-4c45-851b-48c4891e6054","type":"text","value":"a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame. So this is me now just opening a pipette tip on the burner. And now I'm going to pour a medium into the plate. So I've got my medium which is hot and I'm now going to pour it into the plate I need to keep the plates as close to the fire as possible and the bottle as well. Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing. So whatever has descended on the tip of the bottle need to be sterilized. Now I'm going to show you how I'm going to strip out bacteria. This is a Staphylococcus aureus culture on a blue plate. And I'm going to transfer that to a stereo plate that I've just prepared. Now this plate is all set. So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame. So this is me now just opening a pipette tip on the burner. And now I'm going to pour a medium into the plate. So I've got my medium which is hot and I'm now going to pour it into the plate I need to keep the plates as close to the fire as possible and the bottle as well. Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing. So whatever has descended on the tip of the bottle need to be sterilized. Now I'm going to show you how I'm going to strip out bacteria. This is a Staphylococcus aureus culture on a blue plate.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200. And then you can use that micropipette on the P 200. Tip. Good.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:31\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you my diluent which is going to be assemble for you can use water in this case for your crystal violet, because what we'll be diluting is 1% crystal violates and this will just help to show the graduation or the reduction of the dilution as we go down the tubes. So I'm just opening the tube now. And I am working within a class to safety cabinet. That's why I don't have a flame with me. Now I've taken my P 1000, which is such to 900 microliters capacity. Now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tip. Now I'm going to take one tip. And I'm going to transfer. As I've shown you in my initial video, you have to press the plunger to the first stop. And now I'm going to add the quote. Now 900 microliters of my di D went into the tubes, I have to add this same quantity to all the tubes 900 microliters, of diluent. And as I've said, I'm using SM buffer. But if you do not want to waste your material, you can equally use water to dilute your crystal violet. But if you're diluting your phage, you will need to use assemble for and as you can see, I'm only allowing just the end of the tip to go into the tube do not exceed that because the only sterile part of the pipette is actually the tip. So now I'm going to put the P 1000. aside and close the eppendorf tubes containing my diluent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 7:10\n\n","    All of these contain my daily but not I'm going to pick the crystal violet that I hope to dilute and is going to be 10 for dilution, because each tube is daily diluted a tenfold to the next two.

So I'm now open my crystal violet. And I'm going to add that to the first tube which is the minus one tube. I'm going to resuspend that couple of time. And I'm going to throw away that pipette tip.

Now I'm going to go in to the minus two tube and take 100 microliters in there and that will be transferred into minus three tube. Now discard it again and pay the fresh tip and not open the minus three and that is how I'm going to do until the crystal violet is diluted tenfold across the tubes. So all you're doing is just gradually diluting your initial stock sample reducing the numbers with the amount by a tenfold Just remember to keep changing the tip as you dilute.\n\n","    Janet Nale 9:58\n\n","    That is the minor six We are graduating to minus seven MCs.

But for this case, this is unnecessary. So I'm just showing you the graduation of the color of the crystal violet within the tube. And as you can see, by the time we get to minus eight, it is basically\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 10:42\n\n","    reduced\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:44\n\n","    drastically to a clear liquid.

So I'm just changing the volume setting till I get 200 microliters. So this is p 200 p pet. So it's set. So to 200. So these are my tips, the p p 200. Tips, which will match my P 200. Micro micro pipette. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters to each of the wells. So I'm going to press again the plunger to the first stop. So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent.

And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200. And then you can use that micropipette on the P 200. Tip. Good.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:31\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you my diluent which is going to be assemble for you can use water in this case for your crystal violet, because what we'll be diluting is 1% crystal violates and this will just help to show the graduation or the reduction of the dilution as we go down the tubes. So I'm just opening the tube now. And I am working within a class to safety cabinet. That's why I don't have a flame with me. Now I've taken my P 1000, which is such to 900 microliters capacity.

In this video, we are going to apply our knowledge on serial dilution to be able to enumerate a phage. So if you haven't seen my previous video on how I use crystal violet, diluting it to decreasing concentration, please, I will really recommend that you have a look at that video because that will greatly help in the understanding of the serial dilution that we are going to conduct now on the phage. So I'm going to dilute this page because I need to enumerate the number of phage, or the concentration of phage within this feature lysate that I have got. So I have got a universal truth here containing some phage. So now I'm going to I have already added SM buffer into the tube. And because I'm going to do my dilution in one meal that is 1000 microliters, I have added 900 microliters of the SM buffer into each of the tubes shown in the video. So I've labeled that minus one to minus eight. And I've picked my P 1000 micropipette. And I've set it to 100 microliters. And now I'm going to use my P 200. Tips, which will fit my P 100. micropipette. I'm going to take one of each and transfer 100 microliters. So if you refer back to my video, the crystal violet, I have to use the same method to dilute the crystal violet. And this is a 10 fold serial dilution. So 100 microliters of the phage lysate is going to be transferred to my first tube containing my 900 microliters of the diamond which is SM buffer and I'm mixing it by pipetting up and down just a couple of times using the plunger. I'm going to throw that tip away. And I'm going to take a fresh tip you have to change the tip because you're moving for from a higher concentration to a lower concentration or in your diner. And so I've just aspirated 100 microliters of the minus one diluted sample, and I've added it to the minus two tube, mix it throw away the tape, I'm not taking a fresh tip, and going in to the minus two tube aspirating 100 microliters and then adding that to the minus three tube. And I'm just mixed it might be putting up and down, threw away that pipette tip and then taking the minus three removing hundred microliters into minus four. So this is just diluting my phage from a very high concentration to low concentration in a systematic way using 10 fold dilution methods. And it is reducing my phage to a certain amount that I will be able to count. Now I'm adding from the minus five to minus six. throwing away the pet got fresh pet back to minus six. Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight. So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish.

So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage.

Because it is very important to understand what I did in that previous video for you to be able to understand and interpret the result we are going to see here. So just to recap, in that previous video, all I did was to conduct 10 for serial dilution of a phage in SM buffer, and then supported 10 microliters. of the serially diluted phage on a lawn of a bacterium, I cultured the whole setup in 37 degrees centigrade overnight. And now I'm going to check the plates. So this is the plate. And if you remember the plate, I divided it into eight different sections. And as you can see, you can see Clarence on the lawn, so around the area where I did not sport, you would see cloudiness. And this just shows the bacteria has grown. So this is the first thing you want to look for.

And you can see complete clearance from the minus one because you have more fish there are reduced clearance or plaques across till you got to the minus six. So this is a type of results you are expecting to see if you conduct your serial dilution correctly.

<summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 0:01\n\n","    Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials. Now when we look at how this falls into development for antimicrobial therapy, we know that since the 1980s, the number of new antibacterial agents being discovered and developed is drastically decreasing. So here you can see that there were about 16 new agents that were discovered in the 1980s. And then we have as few as two between 2008 and 2012. Now this is partially due to the fact that clinical trials are extremely expensive. So here you can see that the estimate is you know, 400 and $60 million. If you want to believe During a clinical drug to market, and this is just something that's extremely difficult to do. And unfortunately, antibiotics are not something that drug companies can then make a lot of money out of. So they have less of an inherent motivation to put money into a clinical trial, because they have less ability to get money back out of the drug being authorized itself. And we put this into the context of antimicrobial resistance. And we realize that we're really on the clock here, in order to develop new anti microbial therapies in order to address the problems that we're seeing with antibiotic failures. Now, we've touched a little bit here and there about the different phases of clinical trials from zero to four. And when we start at zero, this is usually just an observational study. So this is when you're not applying any type of product to a patient, you're just simply trying to look and see what the demographics or the epidemiology of your target population is. And then you can move on to safety. So this is phase one. And we said earlier that traditionally, this is done in healthy subjects. So you would be putting your product or your phages into a healthy person, and just making sure that when everything else is going well, that the drug product itself isn't causing any adverse effects. And then phase two is we're still of course, considering safety, we always consider safety. But this is when we start to look at efficacy, because now we're normally in a patient population that is afflicted by the\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:43\n\n","    the condition that we're trying to treat. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 26:46\n\n","    then once we move into phase three, this is really where we're trying to decide or to determine if the product is effective for treating a specific condition or not. And you have a larger population size than what you did in phase two trials. Now, it's at this point that after the completion, the successful completion of a phase three trial, that it would be possible to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. And this is really again, what companies really try to do with their drugs is because once they obtain a marketing authorization, and they're able to sell, sell, distribute and treat patients, but even after a drug or a product receives a marketing authorization, they're still phase four studies. So this is called post marketing surveillance studies. And this is when it's still\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 27:41\n\n","    required that the company would then follow patients who are receiving this drug over a longer amount of time to make sure that there's no adverse effects that develop on a larger scale. And we when we look at the different phases, in terms of what's been done for phage therapy, there's been a number of different phase one trials done to determine safety. And this is this will cover different types of infections. And we'll cover healthy volunteers as well as some even some patients. And this will cover a lot of different products from something as you know, as simple as a single phage, something as complex as maybe 10 or 12 pages or so there's been a number of these phase one studies done. And there's also been several efficacy studies. So these are the phase two studies that have already been completed.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:33\n\n","    And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 28:35\n\n","    this is really where the next section we're going to delve into these four phase two trials that have been completed for phage therapy. And if you want to have a little look and read deeper into the literature, I'll just tell you here now before we take a break, the four different publications that we'll discuss more in detail. So the first one was by right and all in 2009. And this is a controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteria phage preparation and chronic otitis due to antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and it's a preliminary report of efficacy. Now, the second trial that was published was oral phage therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea with to Cali phage preparations and a randomized control trial and children from Bangladesh. This was published by sarker and all in 2016. And\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:32\n\n","    then a third trial we have\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 29:34\n\n","    was the Fagor burn trial if you've ever heard of that, this is the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of bacteriophages to treat burn wound infected by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a randomized controlled double blind Phase One Two trial This was published by jolt and all in 2019 in The Lancet, and very recently, in a trial that I was involved with was the intro vesicle bacteriophages for treating urinary tract infections and patients undergoing transfer through a resection of the prostate, a randomized placebo controlled double blind trial. So all of them have these, you know, very long and complex titles. So if you're interested, you can take the time to read them individually. And I would suggest trying to look at the titles and pick out this Pico information. So the population outcome control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:29\n\n","    P. control\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 30:33\n\n","    those letters that we talked about earlier, you can come back and look at them, but just have a look at the title.

So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 4:24\n\n","    Now, why do we do clinical trials? And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 8:50\n\n","    So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 13:50\n\n","    And then if we talk about another trial, so as time goes on, we get increasingly stricter and more ethical frameworks for doing clinical trials. And one of the more modern clinical trials, especially in the terms of bacterial infections, comes from 1948. And this is really the time that it was a trial was randomized for the first time, meaning that once patients were enrolled, they would be the physician who was treating them would receive an envelope. And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection. So treatment is the outcome treatment effect. And then last is t what type of study is it. And here you can see that it's randomized, and a double blind clinical trial.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 18:40\n\n","    And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable. So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:16\n\n","    And extremely importantly, is that you used\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 23:19\n\n","    enough patience to show that the effect is true and that what you're seeing is statistically significant. And then when you have the final result of a clinical trial, your outcome would either be the discontinuation or the continuation to the next phase of clinical trials. So if you're in a phase one study, and you show it safe, you can move to a phase two for efficacy. Or if you're already in a phase two, where you've shown early signs of efficacy, you can move on to a phase three trial, which is a larger study of efficacy. Or if you're already at face baby than you might be able to achieve regulatory approval, and the marketing authorization to then sell and distribute the drug to patients. And overall, what this can lead to is a change in current practice.\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:07\n\n","    And this is really something that\n\n","    Shawna McCallin 24:10\n\n","    is important and is a goal of clinical trials.

So all of them have these, you know, very long and complex titles. So if you're interested, you can take the time to read them individually.

So thanks for signing into the lecture today, which will be about clinical trials for phage therapy. And just to get you started off with, I wanted to see how many of you would be willing to take this medication. So this is aspirin, this is something that I'm sure all of us have taken at some point in our life, and is a household name around the globe. And ask yourself, you know, why do you feel comfortable taking aspirin? And then ask yourself, would you take this medicine? This is the Pio bacteria phage cocktail from the elliana Institute in Tbilisi and Georgia, where it is sold as an over the counter medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections. And these are the types of answers that are questions I would like to talk about today in this lecture. So we're going to start off with a question in terms of why do we actually do clinical trials. Before we go into a brief history on how we started experimenting and structuring experiments, when we use human subjects, then we'll go on to look at the main parts of the clinical study, before going into modern trials that have done for clinical phage therapy. And lastly, then off with I want to go over and summarize these clinical trials in order to give a perspective of phage therapy for the future. And to sort of break this up a little, we're gonna divide the lecture into two different parts. So the first part here will be covering topics one through three, and then we'll take a short break. And you can log into the second part, where we really do a deep dive into the different trials for phage therapy. And if you aren't familiar with drug development, there's this pretty basic step by step process that happens where we start off with a good idea. And then we do some basic research to back up that idea. Now, this is really where it's done in universities and colleges and different institutions. And it's probably what we are all most familiar with, when we're working with phage therapy, where we isolate phages from the environment, then we test their activity against different strains. So this will combine both the in vitro tests that we will do in our petri dishes and our 96 well plates, as well as in vivo research, or types of studies, where we look at the effect of phages and animal models. Now, this really goes then transition from the discovery phase into the development phase one, we start to go into humans. So once we see that, okay, our phages have a good activity against the bacteria, either in vitro or in vivo. And we start thinking, alright, well, maybe this could actually work to treat infections in humans. And so this is where we enter into clinical trials. Now, clinical trials are divided into different phases. Now we say phases, one, two, and three, they're really the most important ones, because we start off with phase one, which is traditionally done and healthy volunteers. So this is really where we focus on the safety of a specific drug, then we can move into phase two, which starts to look at the efficacy of the phages against a specific indication, and then eventually into phase three, which are also safety studies, but in a larger population. Now, all of these different types of studies are leading up to where we can start to actually deliver phage therapy or any other type of drug to the market. And this we end up going through is the process is called regulatory approval. And we'll talk a little bit more about what regulatory agencies actually do here. And then the final step, of course, is then when we have a product that we can use for patient care.","properties":{"title":[["Hi, everyone, I am Dr. Shawna McKellen and I am a phage and clinical researcher at the vulgaris University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland.

And of course, the most fundamental thing is we're going to try to answer a question. And the trial itself is like an experiment where we will generate data to provide evidence evidence to see if First of all, a drug is safe. This is always the most important thing to to look at first when we are working with humans is to make sure that when we first do the applications that they are safe into the population we are going to provide them to and then also if a drug is effective, so even if we have a drug that's safe, it also has to do what we say it's actually going to do. So if we're saying, you know, phages are going to be used for bacterial infections, we need to make sure that we have shown evidence that indeed, phages can treat bacterial infections. And then the way that clinical trials are done is there's usually two main people or entities that are involved with conducting clinical trials. Now, the first one is known as a sponsor. Now, this is the person or organization or entity that is responsible for the initiation, management and or financing of the trial. And this is slightly different than than the other major entity, which is a person which is the investigator. And this is the person was almost entirely always a physician, who is responsible for the conduct of the trial on site. Now, sometimes you can have a structure where the investigator is the initiator. So they also serve as the sponsor of the trial, it just depends. But usually you've got the structure of the sponsor, which may be a company, or an institution or an individual, and then the investigator who is the clinician, or the clinician team that is responsible for actually doing and carrying out the trial. And the major goal of clinical trials is to obtain a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities. So we saw this in the previous slide, where you get to the point of not phase one, phase two, but phase three trials, where you get to have a marketing authorization if you can show that your drug is safe and effective. And this will be delivered by the marketing authorities or the regulatory authorities. And this will allow the sales, distribution and access to the drug that's being developed. Now, some of the regulatory authorities you may have heard of before. So in the United States, we've got the FDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration, then in Europe, we have the European Medicines Agency. Now this acts as sort of the umbrella organization for European countries, but most European countries also have their own national regulatory authority. For example, Switzerland, where I'm located, we don't we're not part of the European Union. But we also have our own Regulatory Authority called Swiss medic. And then, in Australia, for example, they have a Therapeutic Goods authority, and then also other countries. So the last time where we were doing the workshop, in January 2020, we were in Tanzania, and Tanzania has the food and drugs authority as their regulatory authority in the country. And I thought it worthwhile mentioning that Tanzania is one of the first confirmed country in Africa to achieve a well functioning regulatory system for Medicinal Products, according to the World Health Organization. So this might be an interesting time to see whatever country you're located in to look up who your national regulatory authority is. So what do these regulatory authorities actually do? while they're very important for the development of medicines, because they act as both the gatekeeper to the market and the watch keeper of the market, so they will control access into the market. And they will also make sure that everybody, all the drugs or Medicinal Products that are in the market, are also being used safely. And their responsibilities then are to ensure that the medicines that are available for sales and distribution are of extremely high quality, and this way they protect patients and societies.","properties":{"title":[["Now, why do we do clinical trials?

And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients. And we'll talk also a little bit more about how this can be done in a little bit. But it's also a very important mechanism in order to reduce bias and clinical trials. So if we talk a little bit more recently, during World War Two, there was really catastrophic treatment of humans who were kept in Germany in concentration camps, where the Nazi soldiers carried out a lot of human experimentation in inhumane manners. and due to this catastrophe, and as a result of the resolution of the Second World War, World War, there is the development of a large number of ethical codes, so to to look up could be the Nuremberg Code, as well as the Helsinki declaration, which really outlined how we would treat patients ethically when we were using, or we were enrolling them in a clinical trial. And just as a result, some of the things that came out from this experience was that ethical committees are needed in order to approve clinical trials. So in addition to regulatory agencies, you also will have a ethical committee for each trial. And this is usually done locally, at the hospital or at the institution where you want to carry out the trial. And also, as a result, there's informed consent, meaning that the patient has to be provided with information and have their questions answered, and then consent to being part of the study, rather than enrolling them without their knowledge or against their will. And also, with this informed consent, this gives patients the right to withdraw from a study at any point in time for any reason, as well as the right to privacy of his or her data.","properties":{"title":[["So now, if we go back and we look a little bit at where clinical trials came from, from a historical perspective, usually we cite you know, the first clinical trial is coming out from 1747, so quite some time ago, and this was by James Lind, who is looking at scurvy and sailors, sailors who have been out to sea have been were developing scurvy. And we're quite sick, and there is no way to really treat them. So what James Lind did is he took a group of 12 patients or sailors at the time, and divided them into six different groups. And you can see here down in the corner that the group's they received each a different type of treatment. So group one got drops of elixir of vitriol, group two got sea water, group three how to spicy paste, glad that wasn't me. And group four got vinegar, group five, they got cider, whereas group six got two oranges and a lemon. And eventually we figured out they saw there that the group six really responded positively to oranges In lemon, which was due to their vitamin C content. Now, as much as this is a very, was very novel for the time where somebody took a group and then gave them different treatments to see which one could be effective, there's still a lot of problems with the way that this trial was designed. And you can see here that first of all, that having such a small population means that there's a high probability of what they saw in those patients as being due to chance. So the results that they obtained here, we would not consider to be significant. So here, you've got only two patients who received each of the treatments. A second problem with this structure is that there was no randomization, meaning that each patient came in, I mean, you may have just given the first to the first treatment, or the first, the last to the last treatment, so there was no way of just changing them up. So you had a random allocation of the treatment to the different patients. And this is something we'll talk about later. And it's very important, because it's something that we use to reduce bias. Now also in the trial, you can see with the different groups, there was no control, meaning that at the time, there was no treatment for scurvy. So there should have still been a control group, which would have been either a placebo, which is, you know, receiving an active ingredient, or standard of care, which was nothing. So there's no way to really compare the effects of these different treatments to what the standard was. And lastly, what was missing is that the experiment, or James Lind, was not blind to the treatments that were being given to the patients. So a lot of times, we put a lot of effort into clinical trials to blind, the treatment that's being given to the patients.

And in that envelope, it would actually tell the doctor to either give the patient a placebo or give them the study drug. And in this context, this was done for the treatment of permanent pulmonary tuberculosis with strep myosin, and as a result of that trial, it was shown that 7% of strep demise and treated patients died, while 27% of control patients died. And this showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality with the administration of strep myosin for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now if we move on a little bit into what clinical trial looks like, and what are the different parts the most important, and again, this reason of why we're doing clinical trials in the first place is to answer a question. And so when we're looking at to develop our research question, the first thing is to identify the problem, or what is a missing piece of information in a field. So for example, when we talk about infections, we know that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Or if there's a certain infection, and the treatment isn't working, so we have a high number of treatment failures. So here's some eye examples of problems that we have in infectious disease. And then the also the other part of a research question means to be that we have to identify and test a possible solution. In our case here today, of course, this is bacteria phages. And I just wrote an acronym here that's commonly used in order to structure when you're trying to design and formulate your research question is finer. So you want to make sure that your research question is feasible, and interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant. So when you're trying to design your research question, these are things to keep in mind. And now when we look at it, there's also another acronym called peacocks. pika p, IC o t. And this helps to identify the different parts of your study that are important in order to communicate information. This is also going to be really useful for when we're talking about studies later to pick out the information even from just a study title. So if we look at an example, here, we've got the inter vesicle bacteria phages for treating urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial. Now, usually, the titles of clinical trials are like this, it's a mouthful to say, and it's jam packed full of information. So if we use the Pico sort of structure, we can pick out what information is important. So the P stands for population. So who is going to be treated, and in this case, this is patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, who have urinary tract infections, then the second thing we want to know is the intervention, what is being tested. So this is intra vesicle, bacteria phages. So this is where bacteria phages are actually put up through a catheter into the bladder. Now, the third letter is C. So this stands for control. And what are we going to compare? What are the investigators comparing the intervention against, and in this case, we've got a placebo control. We'll also see later that they also included a standard of care control. Then next we have the outcome for Oh, which is the clinical measure or expected results. And in this case, the clinical measure, I would say, isn't particularly well defined here. But we can say that they're measuring the ability of the phages to treat urinary tract infection.

So the first thing is to randomize the allocation of the different treatments. So meaning that you don't know which patient is coming in, you don't know which study product they're going to receive. So it's not that you know, your first 10 patients get bacteria phages. And then your second 10 patients, they get placebo. It's that when you get your first patient in, they've got an equal chance if you're doing a one to one randomization, that they may or may not get the study product. And this way, if you have not knowing which treatment each patient receives means that you don't, you can't anticipate or expect an effect. And a second way to design your trial is to make sure that you try to blind it as much as possible. And this means who knows which treatment. Now you can do single blind where it's just the patient who doesn't understand or doesn't know which treatment they're receiving. You could do double blind where both the patient and the physician who is administering the drug, don't know which one they're in ministering, this is when you typically have a study product and, and placebo, and they both look and smell identical. And this way they can be given in the same way. And then another mechanism of to design your trial to make sure it's the most robust as possible is to add in a control. So this is where you can use your placebo, or you can use a standard of care, such as an antibiotic comparateur. And these three things are really different design tools where you can reduce the bias. So bias is really where you can, unintentionally or intentionally introduce sort of ways to stack your trial one way or another to get the effect that you would like to see. So for example, if you didn't randomize your clinical trial, maybe subconsciously, you would be giving phages to the healthier patients, whereas giving placebo to the patients who have more severe cases. So again, it's just a way to ensure that everybody who's doing the trial isn't biasing the results. And then one of the most important things in in the design of a clinical trial is to identify what your outcomes are going to be or what your expected effects are, and how you're going to measure them. So we have primary outcomes, secondary outcome, sometimes even tertiary or exploratory outcomes. And these are really like what is going to be the judge if your clinical trial is effective, or, or not. So primary outcome is usually something that is patient centric, meaning you want to see if your patients are getting better or not. And then a lot of times, especially in the cases of bacteria phage trials is your secondary outcome. So still something that's important to measure, but not as important as the primary would be something like microbiology. So did you see that the bacteria at the site of infection decreased over time. And overall, when you're when we're doing clinical trials is you we really want to show that there's a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparator. So in it and are in the case of what we're talking about today is we want to see that phage therapy has a statistically significant difference compared to either placebo, or your standard of care treatment. And we usually measure this significance based off of the p value. So I call it the magical p value, because this statistical measure can have is your defining output if your trial is successful or not. So the criteria for a clinical trial is you want to make sure that you can prove safety that the bacteriophages or the drug in question are safe for the patients, that the trial design did not introduce any major forms of bias that the measures use to judge so your you know, your primary and secondary outcomes were appropriate.","properties":{"title":[["And then when you look into some design aspects of a clinical trial, we talked about some of these things earlier, where it was really important to include them in the design in order to make your study more reliable.

The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:33\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you how to transfer a liquid\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:41\n\n","    into\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:43\n\n","    a 1.5 mil eppendorf tube here.

I have now successfully transfer 500 microliters of the SM buffer to the tube. Remember, you only press to the first stop. If you intend to use this temp tip, do not press beyond the first stop to the second stop. If you do this, you have to release it back to the first stop before you aspirate your liquid. In summary, I showed you that the micropipette was invented by hemorrhage in 1957. And I've also clearly demonstrated to you how you can use the micropipette to transport liquids from one container to the other. I hope this video is useful for you and help you in your microbiology research.

The title of this video is how to use a micropipette. And I've got a picture of one here on my screen. The iPad is an important mechanical device in any microbiology lab, it is used to accurately transfer micro volumes of liquid material from one container to the other. For you to make the most of your micropipette it is important to understand how to use this device effectively. And this video is focused on helping you achieve this. Prior to the invention of micropipettes scientists used to transfer micro volumes of liquids such as bacterial culture or chemicals from one container to the other by pipetting, where the mouth This is not safe. So in 1957, Henry he from the University of harbach, Germany invented the micropipette. I will now walk you through on how to use this pipette effectively now the pipettes come in different sizes or capacities, there is the P 1000, which can effectively transfer up to 1000 microliters of liquid material at room temperature then the P 200 can effectively transfer up to 200 microliters of liquid material, then we've got the P 100. That can transfer up to 100 microliters of liquid material. This is followed by the P 20. And that can transfer up to 20 microliters of liquid material, then the P two and this micropipette can transfer up to two microliters of liquid material. The last but not the least is the p tag and that can transfer up to 10 microliters of liquid material at room temperature. These are the different capacities of micro puppets that I have got to show you today. To use the micro puppets, you need the appropriate tips for them. This box contained the P 1000 tips and these go with the P 1000 micropipette. This box contains the P 200 tips. And these go with either the P 100 or p 200 micropipettes. This is the P 20 tips. And these go with either the p 20 p 10. Or the P two micro packs. I will now show you how to adjust the volume of the micropipettes. I will take an example using my P 1000 micropipette. And as you can see, the thousand shows four digits. But on the controller, you have three digits. This means whatever number you see here is one digit short of the actual capacity that you're going to take using this pipette. So if you see a T on the controller, it means you are taking 800 microliters. This is the plunger that would help you to aspirate and release any liquid within your pipette tips.","properties":{"title":[["Hello everyone, this is dr. john x nalli from the University of Leicester.

And this video today is going to be on Bunsen burners. Person burners are very important in a microbiology lab, you need them to maintain aseptic condition where you work with microorganisms. This is because the air within the lab is not stay around. There are contaminations coming from external sources from aerosols. As we speak, or centrifuge cultures. All these things play a huge role into contaminating our samples. And we need to protect the experiments that we are doing is patiently when you work with bacteria phages. Because their pages are very sensitive, they are very specific, they need to infect the correct organism for you to have an appropriate data to make the right inference to your results. If you have contamination taking place within the culture, these might take over the culture and you might not have sufficient bacterial host for your phages to infect. And this will potentially affect your results. So there is need for you to keep a sterile environment when you work with phages. So today I'm going to walk you through on how you can maintain aseptic condition, whether you're opening your pipette tip boxes, or you're transferring liquids from one chip to the other, or whether you're pouring media who do doing some sports test, you need to maintain a sterile environment. So just a bit of introduction on Bunsen burners. Lee This is an example of one It consists of a tube which has an outlet from which the gas will come out and burn this is the color which you can adjust and this will regulate the amount of oxygen that comes into the burner and regulate the type of flame you obtain this is the tube will lead into the gas supply. And these tubes need to be perfectly sealed in order to maintain safety in your lab not brought up my lighter. And I'm going to turn on the gas supply and then put on the lighter. And now we have got a flame. And as you can see as I'm twisting the color you can see different light emanating from the tip of the tube. Now this yellow light is important when you're not working with Bunsen burners. This helped to show some physical appearance of the light source so you don't burn yourself or people know or are aware that the burden is on what you need the blue flame in order to maintain a sterile environment as you can see the inner core and the external or the outer cone of the flame. So this is me now just opening a pipette tip on the burner. And now I'm going to pour a medium into the plate. So I've got my medium which is hot and I'm now going to pour it into the plate I need to keep the plates as close to the fire as possible and the bottle as well. Once I'm opening the bottle, I will make sure it is opened right in front of the flame and I'm going to keep the lid open top wise close to the flame as I slightly open the plate and pull my medium once I have sufficient medium in the plate, I will now flame back the tip of the bottle under lead before closing. So whatever has descended on the tip of the bottle need to be sterilized. Now I'm going to show you how I'm going to strip out bacteria. This is a Staphylococcus aureus culture on a blue plate. And I'm going to transfer that to a stereo plate that I've just prepared. Now this plate is all set. So um, as you can see I'm working very close to the flame and I'm just labeling my stereo play\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:01\n\n","    With the opposite name and date now I'm going to take a sterile plastic loop. Now because this is sterile and is plastic, I don't need to flame me but if you work with a metal type, you will need to flame it to Red Hot before usage. So I'm going to now open the plate directly on the fire to maintain sterility you can see even the tip is been held close Lee to the fire and I'm going to streak out the plate this is very important for you to do this on the flame. You don't need to do it farther away from the plate the flame when that is done, we will not have the aseptic condition required for us to have a good bacterial growth. Now this is completed and I will now incubate this. Now I'm working all along under the flame now I'm going to transfer some liquid SM buffer into a tube. And as you can see, all the stuff that I'm using are all very close to the fire as close as possible to maintain safety I will transfer that SM buffer into the tube now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tips on the flame as you can see, the farther you are away from the flame, the less protected you will be. Now I'm going to take the tube containing the buffer and I'm going to just flame the edges and then I'm going to pick pipette tip and aspirate the amount of SM buffer I need. As you can see I flamed back the tube and now I've picked my 1.5 mil eppendorf tube flame it and under the flame as close as possible have ejected out the liquid and Flint or the tube the tube before sealing and then continue with my experiment. When it is not required, you can close the equipment or the stuff that you are using. Now I'm going to transfer some of the SM buffer again from a falcon tube to another Falcon tube. So to do this, I will need to now open the tube containing the SM buffer flame it put down the lead under the flame and then open the second tube flame it and then transfer the amount of liquid I need. As you can see I'm working very close to the burners have now flame the edge of the initial tube and the lead. And now I will flame the tip of the second two as well. And the lead Yes, and you can see everything is working very close closely to the flame. So this is just a summary of how to use a bursting burner. Remember, you need to keep the flame in the blue flame. You need the inner cone to show as well as the outer cone to show and make sure that you walk around or close to the burner as much as possible to ensure sterility. So I hope this video will help you in your research on bacteriophages.

This video is going to be on how to conduct serial dilution. So serial dilution is, is the process you conduct in the lab to be able to enumerate your bacterial phage, or culture that you have within your lysate, or culture of the bacteria. All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight. And so I've got 1.5 meals eppendorf tube, there are eight of them, which I have labeled, they are all empty, there's nothing in there. So I've got minus one labeled to minus eight. And this is dependent on the concentration or the crystal violet, or eventually the phage or bacterium you need to enumerate. If you've got a concentration of lysate or bacteria that is more than 10 to the 10 then you might want to add additional tubes to say minus nine or minus 10. So now I'm going to add some data went into the 1.5 mil eppendorf tube and I'm going to do this using a pipette because I'm going to do this dilution in a total of 1000 microliters. I have now taking my pee 1000 pee pad and set it to 90 which is 900 microliters, which I'm of the dilution that I'm going to add and I've got my appropriate tip which is p 1000. Tip. And that as we know we'll go with my p 1000 p pet. Now because I'm going to do that dilution in 1000 micro liter that is one milliliter of now taking a p 100 p pet. Now in this micropipette I'm going to set it to 100. So you can see is now set to 100. This is p 103 digits, and his three digits over there set at 100. have not taken an appropriate pet tip for my pee 100. So I've taken a p 200 pet tips, which will match my P 100. Micro pet, you can use p 200. Pet as well, if you haven't got p 100. But you will be more accurate if you use the P 100. So when you want to use the P 200. You have to set it again 200. And then you can use that micropipette on the P 200. Tip. Good.\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:31\n\n","    Now I'm going to show you my diluent which is going to be assemble for you can use water in this case for your crystal violet, because what we'll be diluting is 1% crystal violates and this will just help to show the graduation or the reduction of the dilution as we go down the tubes. So I'm just opening the tube now. And I am working within a class to safety cabinet. That's why I don't have a flame with me. Now I've taken my P 1000, which is such to 900 microliters capacity. Now I'm going to open my P 1000 pipette tip. Now I'm going to take one tip. And I'm going to transfer. As I've shown you in my initial video, you have to press the plunger to the first stop. And now I'm going to add the quote. Now 900 microliters of my di D went into the tubes, I have to add this same quantity to all the tubes 900 microliters, of diluent. And as I've said, I'm using SM buffer. But if you do not want to waste your material, you can equally use water to dilute your crystal violet. But if you're diluting your phage, you will need to use assemble for and as you can see, I'm only allowing just the end of the tip to go into the tube do not exceed that because the only sterile part of the pipette is actually the tip. So now I'm going to put the P 1000. aside and close the eppendorf tubes containing my diluent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 7:10\n\n","    All of these contain my daily but not I'm going to pick the crystal violet that I hope to dilute and is going to be 10 for dilution, because each tube is daily diluted a tenfold to the next two. So this is the P 200 tips, which will go with my P 100. I'm going to pick a to a tip Sorry, I'm going to press it to the first plunger. Do not exceed that, or else you're going to take excess amount. So I'm now open my crystal violet. And I'm going to add that to the first tube which is the minus one tube. I'm going to resuspend that couple of time. And I'm going to throw away that pipette tip. After discarding, I will take a fresh tip and transfer material from the minus one\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 8:26\n\n","    tube\n\n","    Janet Nale 8:34\n\n","    into the minus two tube. And I'm going to resuspend that by putting up and down a couple of times to resuspend. And to equally distribute the crystal violet. I've discarded the initial tip and picked a fresh one. Now I'm going to go in to the minus two tube and take 100 microliters in there and that will be transferred into minus three tube. Now discard it again and pay the fresh tip and not open the minus three and that is how I'm going to do until the crystal violet is diluted tenfold across the tubes. So all you're doing is just gradually diluting your initial stock sample reducing the numbers with the amount by a tenfold Just remember to keep changing the tip as you dilute.\n\n","    Janet Nale 9:58\n\n","    That is the minor six We are graduating to minus seven MCs. Good to take that. And now we have added to the minus eight, you may choose to eliminate 100 microliters from the minus minus eight to ensure you've got equal amount. But for this case, this is unnecessary. So I'm just showing you the graduation of the color of the crystal violet within the tube. And as you can see, by the time we get to minus eight, it is basically\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 10:42\n\n","    reduced\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:44\n\n","    drastically to a clear liquid. So for us to actually see this in a visual way, I've now put 96 well plate culture played out. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters of the diluted crystal violet into the well. So I'm just changing the volume setting till I get 200 microliters. So this is p 200 p pet. So it's set. So to 200. So these are my tips, the p p 200. Tips, which will match my P 200. Micro micro pipette. And I'm going to transfer 200 microliters to each of the wells. So I'm going to press again the plunger to the first stop. So I'm going to start from the minus eight to minus one. So if you want to do this method, then you don't need to change your tip where you transfer. So this is minus eight, then to minus seven, I'm using the same tip because I'm starting from the less diluted sample to the higher, diluted sample. Now we'll just do this across the tube, make sure you only stop at the first stop of the plunger. If you exceed to the second stop, then you have to release your thumb and go back again to the first stop before you aspirate your sample. So this is minus two. Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","  </details>\n\n","  \n\n"],"children":["cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","8dd96423-b5ca-4433-bb14-c635df7e0704"],"content":[{"id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","type":"toggle","value":"Show auto-generated subtitles","properties":{"title":[["Show auto-generated subtitles"]]},"parent_id":"e6b5c475-067b-4ebd-8362-5c8a0a07b510","parent_table":"block","markdown":["<details>\n","  <summary>Show auto-generated subtitles</summary>\n\n","    Janet Nale 0:06\n\n","    Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

Remember, for me to keep using the same tip have to start from the less diluted sample from the minus eight to minus one. So I will just show you how the sample has graduated. And you can see the minus one has more material compared to the minus eight on the right hand side. So this is just an exercise to show you how you conduct serial dilution. And this you can do with your phage or your bacterial sample. Before you now further do the spot test, which I'm going to show you in my other videos. Just to summarize, we have just diluted our sample in tenfold to decrease the amount of material in the diluent and in this case, we use SM buffer and we use crystal violet and diluted it across the board. To do this dilution I added 900 microliters of the dye underwent and then use hundred microliters because the total volume that I require to do this dilution is 1000 microliters. You might choose to do less say you want to do your dilution in a less volume. You can use 200 total volume and in this case your daily rent will be 180 microliters and the actual lysate or material that you're diluting will be 20 microliters and that is what you will use Across the board, when you're diluting your sample, remember to change the tip each time, as you add your concentrated sample to minus one, two, you need to change the tip the tip as you aspirate material from minus one to minus two, again that is what you will repeat, you will need to change the tips each time you go\n\n","    Janet Nale 15:27\n\n","    taking samples from the higher concentrated to the lower concentration sample, so, diluted into the diluent. And when you want to now enumerate or you want to support your deleted sample, you can start from the minus eight and graduate to your minus one. And if you do this, you do not need to change the tip. But when you start from minus one and use that stop supporting then you will need to change the tip each time you spot a material from a diluted sample. So, I hope this is important. And you have learned something on how to do serial dilution of any material that you are given in the lab. So, I hope to see you in the next video because in that video, I'm going to show you how to actually conduct serial dilution of a phage and conducts a sports test. So do you buy\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","2c9f9bce-f342-4c2b-8bfc-7a8fafce4544","5c128188-4fab-4349-b761-089a6b8b314a","3ef5090e-9b62-4960-b40e-7d6b1d099a08","ff484326-0c5c-40cf-987d-80a912a7adaf","6ec64614-6d86-4e3e-8f1b-a653ccdfdb63","49eb0cbf-f40c-4062-ba65-fc4cd25d6d0c","895dc0e1-09ac-464d-81ac-6cc34dcf0817","9a52503d-ed10-4ee8-b18e-ff13a094924b","5f1704f0-df56-414d-b786-8a2b6dd1ad4e","3791ee6e-06ee-4311-b371-ab7bb8ece87f","1f971023-b531-41f3-8a9d-bc0e09f84c94","c0f2b33b-f907-4ad9-a9c7-c69aa34accbf","4002a578-0879-4631-bc49-d17fc4f1d4f8","92badb7c-6d05-4919-a75e-0642123a16f9","7cc5d10b-c74e-4e41-b6c8-3d7e875dad12","5bd83d34-7771-4041-b8e9-1d51ed98f488"],"content":[{"id":"24aacce3-9e24-439e-903b-3ee2fad29b9a","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 0:06","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 0:06"]]},"parent_id":"cf418d5e-10ef-4cc2-807e-bd5693321b96","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 0:06\n\n"]},{"id":"852635ff-d0f4-4a1a-97be-e9ad9b7d1943","type":"text","value":"Hello, everyone, this is Dr. Janice nalli.

All you're doing is diluting your phage in a systematic way to reduce the number to a certain convenient level that you can be able to count. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to conduct 10 for serial dilution. But I'm not going to use a phage in this instance, or a bacterium, I'm going to use crystal violet to dilute it. So you can see the decreasing amount or concentration of the crystal violet as we conduct the serial dilution. So in this instance, I'm going to dilute the sample to minus eight.

In this video, we are going to apply our knowledge on serial dilution to be able to enumerate a phage. So if you haven't seen my previous video on how I use crystal violet, diluting it to decreasing concentration, please, I will really recommend that you have a look at that video because that will greatly help in the understanding of the serial dilution that we are going to conduct now on the phage. So I'm going to dilute this page because I need to enumerate the number of phage, or the concentration of phage within this feature lysate that I have got. So I have got a universal truth here containing some phage. So now I'm going to I have already added SM buffer into the tube. And because I'm going to do my dilution in one meal that is 1000 microliters, I have added 900 microliters of the SM buffer into each of the tubes shown in the video. So I've labeled that minus one to minus eight. And I've picked my P 1000 micropipette. And I've set it to 100 microliters. And now I'm going to use my P 200. Tips, which will fit my P 100. micropipette. I'm going to take one of each and transfer 100 microliters. So if you refer back to my video, the crystal violet, I have to use the same method to dilute the crystal violet. And this is a 10 fold serial dilution. So 100 microliters of the phage lysate is going to be transferred to my first tube containing my 900 microliters of the diamond which is SM buffer and I'm mixing it by pipetting up and down just a couple of times using the plunger. I'm going to throw that tip away. And I'm going to take a fresh tip you have to change the tip because you're moving for from a higher concentration to a lower concentration or in your diner. And so I've just aspirated 100 microliters of the minus one diluted sample, and I've added it to the minus two tube, mix it throw away the tape, I'm not taking a fresh tip, and going in to the minus two tube aspirating 100 microliters and then adding that to the minus three tube. And I'm just mixed it might be putting up and down, threw away that pipette tip and then taking the minus three removing hundred microliters into minus four. So this is just diluting my phage from a very high concentration to low concentration in a systematic way using 10 fold dilution methods. And it is reducing my phage to a certain amount that I will be able to count. Now I'm adding from the minus five to minus six. throwing away the pet got fresh pet back to minus six. Taking 100 microliters of that and then adding it to the minus seven mix a couple of times where people take up and down threw away the pet and got a fresh one into minus seven that I've just dropped into now minus eight. So I have now successfully diluted my sample to\n\n","    Janet Nale 4:49\n\n","    a reasonable amount and this is dependent on the phage if your phage is less concentrated, you might use less tube and if he has Better higher concentration, then you might use more dilutions. Now I'm going to spot this dilution or this diluted sample to a confluence bacterial growth agar medium. So, I have now astera Lb plate is 1.5% Lb agar plate and I have divided the plate into section which is corresponding to the amount of dilutions I have conducted on the tubes. So, I have up to minus eight dilution and I have divided the plate into minus eight section.\n\n","    Janet Nale 5:51\n\n","    Now, to create a confluent bacterial growth on their medium, I need a less agar concentrated sample which is good, sorry medium which is not print 7% Lb agar and it is hand warm, you can leave that at 55 degrees centigrade. I've now taken my pet and I need 150 of the bacterial culture. I'm now using my P 200 pipette tip to aspirate 150 microliters. Now, this amount also depends on the bacteria that you are using, you might need more or less so now I'm going to add this to my naught point seven 5% Lb a cost a nice solid medium. And this is for meals. And I'm just miss mixing to homogenize the culture in the semi solid agar medium. So this method is called the double agar layer method. So the bottom layer is the 1.5% Lb agar. And the top one I've just put now, is not point seven 5% Lb agar. So I'm going to do this to the second plate. Always remember to do your enumerations in at least duplicate plate. And I just grabbed a second tube containing four mils of the 0.75% Lb agar medium, I've mixed it with the bacterial culture. And I've just now poured on the surface or the top of the 1.5% agar. So you need to give this time to set. And this depends on the temperature of your lab. So in some instance, you can have, say 10 minutes to allow the plate to completely set. So now I'm going to transfer the diluted sample and I need to transfer 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the double agar plate that I've just prepared. So I'm going to start from minus eight, diluted phage sample. And if you remember from my crystal violet, I started from minus eight. Now I'm not going to change my tip because moving from a more concentrated sample to a less concentrated sample. So I'm keeping my tip. Now this is minus five now I'm going to add that to the minus five section. You don't have to let the tip touch the plate because that already contained bacteria in my quantum nature sample and I'm just adding 10 microliters of the diluted phage sample to the plate. I'm going to do this until I finish spotting 10 microliters from each of the diluted phage samples in the tubes. So once that is finished you can leave your On the safety hood, or on the burner, and you have to leave it slightly open to allow the spotted sample to set or to evaporate, I'm going to take none the second plate. And for this one, I'm going to show you a different way of spotting. So in the initial plate, I set a spotting from minus eight to minus one and I maintained the same tip. But in this instance, I'm going to use my P 20 tips, and my P 20 micropipette.\n\n","    Janet Nale 10:45\n\n","    Set to minus 10. And I'm going to start with a minus one. So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections.

So because the minus one is more concentrated than the other sample, and to avoid to avoid transfer of material from a higher concentrated to a lower concentrated sample, I will need to change the tip. So as you can see, I'm transferring from minus two now to the area. And I need to change the tip up change the tip and I'm taking a fresh one into minus three.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:28\n\n","    And I'm going to do that until I finish. So just remember that when you're working or sporting from a higher concentrated sample, you must need to change the tip to avoid transfer of excess material from the higher concentrated sample to the lower concentrated sample.\n\n","    Janet Nale 11:56\n\n","    So I'm going to continue to change the tip as I move along, transferring 10 microliters of the sample across the section area on the plate. So this is minus seven. And now minus eight.\n\n","    Unknown Speaker 12:27\n\n","    Excellent.\n\n","    Janet Nale 12:29\n\n","    So once this is done, I'm going to now leave the second plate as well slightly open under the hood to allow them to set this is very important because you don't want spilling all the material sported to spill to the other sections. So you have to allow it to set. So I'm going to close the tip now, once it is said and I'm going to incubate this the right side up. So this is important, you don't want to invert your plates because that will spill your sample. So, I hope you have learned how to conduct serial dilution of a phage. And now, we will move to see how you can what to expect on the plate and this is after incubation 24 hours in 37 degrees centigrade and this is also dependent on the bacteria that you're using for this particular enumeration it was done on a salmonella, an appropriate phage. So I will now incubate it at 37 degrees centigrade anaerobically for 24 hours, and the next day I will now check for clearance on this sported sections. Thank you\n\n","</details>\n\n"],"children":["cd339060-773e-43db-8788-d767b01ca0cb","27cba1a7-e764-4963-b67e-360b79efd5b5","52652128-5a30-4916-85d1-6e7b9c7705e4","4a0adb0a-3bd2-489b-982b-d93e8a4e9cdd","8331f157-f4e0-4572-a722-d4634a0d41f4","40c94dab-a278-4154-b55b-cae86d8ce2fe","945ff7ed-5ee4-492c-a0b4-511f3e63988b","8b6c4392-4800-4e12-87bc-ea0cf9885a9d","0350434d-ce5e-4526-b9a4-b9543e205d5b","569412a8-60a8-41ef-8bd0-d9154a25f002","b98203e9-72a8-4c09-968d-d4d2547ccda5","39d5eae2-f522-4705-98bf-c74d4c0cacbc","9eab8ab9-ba91-41f0-ac31-045ad1e00e9a","6904cf8e-f0e1-4e1c-bdfc-242d55f77324","efede8fe-9c15-4ab9-8550-f44c1eda8e89","8c71cd8f-ca15-48ae-afb6-fe85de9e1d39","9a494394-cdcb-4c89-b39f-d9716418e43e"],"content":[{"id":"cd339060-773e-43db-8788-d767b01ca0cb","type":"text","parent_id":"c12eb519-8872-4d46-93a1-2b65a4e718d5","parent_table":"block","markdown":["\n\n"]},{"id":"27cba1a7-e764-4963-b67e-360b79efd5b5","type":"text","value":"Janet Nale 0:01","properties":{"title":[["Janet Nale 0:01"]]},"parent_id":"c12eb519-8872-4d46-93a1-2b65a4e718d5","parent_table":"block","markdown":["Janet Nale 0:01\n\n"]},{"id":"52652128-5a30-4916-85d1-6e7b9c7705e4","type":"text","value":"Hello, everyone is Dennis nalli back again with another video.

Because it is very important to understand what I did in that previous video for you to be able to understand and interpret the result we are going to see here. So just to recap, in that previous video, all I did was to conduct 10 for serial dilution of a phage in SM buffer, and then supported 10 microliters. of the serially diluted phage on a lawn of a bacterium, I cultured the whole setup in 37 degrees centigrade overnight. And now I'm going to check the plates. So this is the plate. And if you remember the plate, I divided it into eight different sections. And as you can see, you can see Clarence on the lawn, so around the area where I did not sport, you would see cloudiness. And this just shows the bacteria has grown. So this is the first thing you want to look for. Because if you don't have a good loan, you will not have a good spot test because there will be no bacteria for your phage to infect so you can see the zone of clearance. And you can see complete clearance from the minus one because you have more fish there are reduced clearance or plaques across till you got to the minus six. So this is a type of results you are expecting to see if you conduct your serial dilution correctly. So in my next video, I'm going to show you how I will calculate the plaque forming unit of these phage that I have just enumerated. I'll see you in that video.
